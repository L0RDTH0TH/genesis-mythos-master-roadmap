### 2026-03-19 10:40 — Duplicate state artifact recalibration

> [!warning]
> `RECAL-ROAD` detected duplicate appended state documents in roadmap artifacts (`roadmap-state`, `workflow_state`, `decisions-log`, `distilled-core`) that can cause validator false negatives and conflicting state reads.
>
> **Drift score:** `0.42` (high, structural)
> **Handoff drift contribution:** `0.18`
> **Action:** normalize each artifact to a single canonical frontmatter/body block, preserve latest valid state row, and re-run hostile validator gate.

### 2026-03-19 00:02 — State hygiene follow-up

> [!success]
> Lineage refreshed after deepen run `resume-roadmap-genesis-mythos-master-2026-03-12`. Duplicate-state warning remains as historical context from prior RECAL event; current canonical state files were updated in one pass with pre/post snapshots.

### 2026-03-19 11:32 — State Hygiene Proof (current run)

- Duplicate scan (roadmap-state/workflow-state/decisions-log/distilled-core): none detected in canonical artifacts.
