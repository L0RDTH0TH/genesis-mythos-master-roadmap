# Roadmap state (execution) — sandbox-genesis-mythos-master

Execution-track progress. Conceptual source of truth: [[../roadmap-state]].

**Prep:** First-mint posture — prior live notes archived under `4-Archives/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master/Roadmap-Execution-reset-2026-04-10-operator/`; Execution root holds only this file and [[workflow_state-execution]]. Authority: [[../decisions-log|decisions-log]] **D-Exec-operator-reset-2026-04-10 (sandbox)**. Dual-track: [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Docs/Dual-Roadmap-Track|Dual-Roadmap-Track]].

## Phase summaries

- Phase 1: in-progress — **primary execution mirror minted 2026-04-10** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture-Roadmap-2026-03-30-0430]] (`handoff_readiness` **87**; matches execution primary frontmatter; AC table + deferrals); **secondary 1.1 minted 2026-04-07** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-1-Layering-and-Interface-Contracts/Phase-1-1-Layering-and-Interface-Contracts-Roadmap-2026-03-30-0500]] (`handoff_readiness` **85**; typed interfaces + pseudocode + AC table); **tertiary 1.1.1 minted 2026-04-10** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-1-Layering-and-Interface-Contracts/Phase-1-1-1-Layer-Boundary-and-Commit-Pipeline-Roadmap-2026-03-30-0431]] (`handoff_readiness` **86**; commit gateway interfaces + deterministic AC rows); **secondary 1.2 minted 2026-04-10** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-2-Procedural-Generation-Graph-Skeleton/Phase-1-2-Procedural-Generation-Graph-Skeleton-Roadmap-2026-03-30-1605]] (`handoff_readiness` **86**; generation graph contracts + deterministic ordering AC rows); **tertiary 1.2.1 minted 2026-04-07** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-2-Procedural-Generation-Graph-Skeleton/Phase-1-2-1-Node-Taxonomy-Edges-and-Topological-Order-Roadmap-2026-03-30-1705]] (`handoff_readiness` **87**; node taxonomy, edge semantics, and deterministic topological-order AC rows); **tertiary 1.2.2 minted 2026-04-08** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-2-Procedural-Generation-Graph-Skeleton/Phase-1-2-2-Graph-Execution-Semantics-and-Subgraph-Runs-Roadmap-2026-03-30-1805]] (`handoff_readiness` **88**; deterministic subgraph closure, wave policy constraints, and commit-boundary AC rows); **tertiary 1.2.3 minted 2026-04-08** — [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-2-Procedural-Generation-Graph-Skeleton/Phase-1-2-3-Stage-Families-Specialization-and-Pipeline-Roles-Roadmap-2026-03-30-1905]] (`handoff_readiness` **89**; family-role contracts, specialization boundaries, deterministic role-transition AC rows); deferrals **DEF-REG-CI** / **DEF-GMM-245** remain explicit. **next:** execution Phase 1 roll-up `handoff-audit` and closure evidence attestation
- Phase 2: pending
- Phase 3: pending
- Phase 4: quarantined stub — **2026-04-08** execution mirror stub for conceptual **4.2** UX amendment (D-2026-04-08) moved to quarantine because execution cursor is Phase 1.2.3: [[Quarantine/Future-Phase-PreMints/Phase-4-2-Session-Orchestration-and-Perspective-Control-Coherence-Roadmap-2026-04-03-2120]] (`status: quarantined`; `handoff_readiness: 0`; parallel spine placeholder only — not a roll-up). Authoritative conceptual behavior: [[../Phase-4-Perspective-Split-and-Control-Systems/Phase-4-2-Session-Orchestration-and-Perspective-Control-Coherence/Phase-4-2-Session-Orchestration-and-Perspective-Control-Coherence-Roadmap-2026-04-03-2120]]
- Phase 5: pending
- Phase 6: pending

## Notes

- **Historical (pre–2026-04-10):** An empty `Roadmap/Execution/**` tree was **expected** immediately after bootstrap; the first execution **`RESUME_ROADMAP` `deepen`** mints the parallel spine.
- **Current (2026-04-08):** Phase **1** primary + secondary **1.1** + tertiary **1.1.1** + secondary **1.2** + tertiaries **1.2.1**, **1.2.2**, and **1.2.3** execution mirrors are on disk — see **## Phase summaries**. Authoritative next structural target is Phase 1 roll-up evidence reconciliation (`handoff-audit`) after tertiary chain closure.
- **Roll-up guardrail:** Tertiary **1.2.3** is now minted and linked in the `1.2` branch; Phase 1 execution roll-up remains open with canonical authority tuple `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `state: Open (advisory pending closure attestation)` until refreshed `handoff-audit` evidence is attached.
- **Closure-proof refresh (2026-04-08 09:22Z):** Added closure-proof artifact [[../../../3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-execution-phase1-rollup-closure-proof-20260408T092247Z]] and linked it from the Phase 1 execution primary closure-evidence anchor. Tuple remains intentionally open until compare validator returns `log_only` with no `missing_roll_up_gates` family codes.
- **State-sync (2026-04-08 queue repair):** `last_run` is pinned to the latest authoritative workflow row family (**2026-04-10 13:43:00Z** sync-outputs). Phase 1 primary roll-up remains intentionally **Open (advisory)** until compare-validator closure attestation clears blocker-family codes; this is a policy gate, not a metadata drift.
- **Nested helper attestation evidence:** [[workflow_state-execution#Nested helper attestation evidence]] (machine-verifiable timestamps tracked there; do not treat prose-only claims as proof).
- **Safety unknown gap (hygiene refresh 2026-04-08):** Hostile `safety_unknown_gap` is **not** tracked against tertiary **1.2.2** anymore because [[Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-2-Procedural-Generation-Graph-Skeleton/Phase-1-2-2-Graph-Execution-Semantics-and-Subgraph-Runs-Roadmap-2026-03-30-1805]] is minted with deterministic closure and AC coverage. Residual safety uncertainty is now explicitly bounded to **cross-slice roll-up chronology/attestation completeness**; tertiary **1.2.3** is minted and the remaining blocker is `phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`.
- **Workflow log supersession (2026-04-08 18:52Z, IRA):** [[workflow_state-execution]] ## Log row **`2026-04-08 15:23`** remains **append-only history** but must **not** be read as live “next mint **1.2.2**” routing — tertiaries **1.2.2**/**1.2.3** are minted; see **Phase summaries** + **2026-04-08 18:52** supersession row. **Primary rollup** stays Open only for **compare/attestation**, not missing subgraph nodes.
- **Automation `safety_unknown_gap` bounds (IRA):** Residual “unknown” splits cleanly into (a) **DEF-REG-CI** / **DEF-GMM-245** automation-proof deferrals per the registry table — **not** silently production-closed — and (b) **roll-up/compare attestation** pending (`compare_validator_required: true`), **not** “missing **1.2.2** slice” once that note exists on disk.
- **Roll-up evidence (DEF-\*):** Evidence notes [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-phase1-rollup-registry-ci]] and [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-phase1-rollup-gmm245]] were refreshed on **2026-04-08** to include the **1.2.1** mirror and to mark **evidence-complete for L1 hostile review** for deferral traceability (automation proof still deferred per DEF rows).

#### Phase 1 closure gate checklist

- [ ] `compare_validator_required: true` is consumed by a fresh compare pass after latest hygiene reconciliation.
- [ ] Latest compare report clears blocker-family codes (`missing_roll_up_gates`, `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`).
- [ ] Only then set `phase_1_rollup_closed: true` and retire `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`.

### Handoff-audit repair compare hold (execution) — 2026-04-08T12:03Z — `handoff-audit-repair-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T115101Z`

- Ran explicit repair-class handoff-audit compare cycle for Phase 1 execution roll-up on this queue entry: first pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-auto-execution-20260408T120106Z]] then compare pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-auto-execution-20260408T120330Z]].
- Final compare result remains `primary_code: missing_roll_up_gates`, `recommended_action: needs_work`, `regression_status: same`; closure tuple stays open by policy (`phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true`).
- Scope discipline maintained: execution authority surfaces only; no conceptual phase-note body edits; no queue mutation in Layer 2.

- Ran execution Phase 1 roll-up closure compare cycle for this repair-class queue entry: first pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-followup-handoff-audit-execution-rollup-closure-sandbox-20260408T120900Z]] then compare pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-followup-handoff-audit-execution-rollup-closure-sandbox-20260408T120900Z-second-pass-20260408T121905Z]].
- Final compare remained `primary_code: missing_roll_up_gates`, `recommended_action: needs_work`, `regression_status: same`, `reason_codes: [missing_roll_up_gates, blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit]`; closure tuple stays open by policy (`phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true`).
- Scope discipline maintained: execution authority surfaces only; no conceptual phase-note body edits; no queue mutation in Layer 2.

- Repair-class rerun on execution Phase 1 roll-up closure with explicit evidence matrix anchoring in [[Execution/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture-Roadmap-2026-03-30-0430#Handoff-audit closure evidence (execution)]] (`repair_run_id` + closure chain status).
- Canonical tuple remains intentionally open while blocker-family codes persist: `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true`; follow-up must not be suppressed until compare pass clears `missing_roll_up_gates` and `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`.
- Scope discipline maintained: execution authority surfaces only; no conceptual phase-note body edits; no queue mutation in Layer 2.

- **Post–`empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T181500Z`:** reconciled execution cursor **`1.2.3`** and tertiary chain **1.2.1–1.2.3** mint-complete on the live parallel spine; updated Phase 1 execution primary closure-evidence block (`repair_run_id_latest`, `post_empty_bootstrap_reconcile`, `compare_to_report_path_lineage`) and superseded stale **## Next execution slices** pre-mint bullets that contradicted post-reset mint-complete reality.
- **Tuple authority unchanged:** `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true` until a fresh nested compare pass clears `missing_roll_up_gates` / `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit` (lineage anchor: [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-followup-handoff-audit-execution-rollup-closure-sandbox-20260408T120900Z-second-pass-20260408T121905Z]]).
- **Scope:** execution authority surfaces only (`Roadmap/Execution/**`); no conceptual frozen-body edits; no prompt-queue mutation in Layer 2. `parent_run_id: eat-queue-sandbox-20260408-layer1` \| `pipeline_mode_used: balance`.

### Handoff-audit compare-next DEF hygiene (execution) — 2026-04-08T20:18Z — `followup-handoff-audit-exec-phase1-rollup-compare-next-20260408T201800Z`

- **Intent:** Continue Phase 1 primary rollup closure loop with pinned lineage awareness; refresh DEF evidence notes to remove stale **1.2.2** / `missing_execution_node_1_2_2` contradictions vs live spine (**1.2.1–1.2.3** minted).
- **Nested cycle:** first pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-auto-exec-phase1-rollup-compare-next-20260408T201800Z-first-pass.md]] → IRA → hygiene on [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-phase1-rollup-registry-ci]] + [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-phase1-rollup-gmm245]] → second pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-auto-exec-phase1-rollup-compare-next-20260408T201800Z-second-pass.md]] (`regression_status: improved`; residual `missing_roll_up_gates`, `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`).
- **Authority:** **`phase_1_rollup_closed` not flipped** — tuple remains `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true` until a pass returns `log_only` with no rollup blocker-family codes per **## Phase 1 closure gate checklist**.
- **Pinned lineage anchor (audit):** [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-followup-handoff-audit-execution-rollup-closure-sandbox-20260408T120900Z-second-pass-20260408T121905Z]] (supplementary; **not** a closure grant).

- **Supplementary to `233000Z`:** Layer 1 dispatch **`eatq-sandbox-20260408-l1-b`** re-ran balance-mode nested **`roadmap_handoff_auto`** for Phase 1 roll-up with **lineage compare** anchored to empty-bootstrap first pass; **does not** supersede **`233000Z`** DEF hygiene cycle — adds parallel attestation trail only.
- **Authority unchanged:** `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true` until a pass returns `log_only` with no `missing_roll_up_gates` / `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`.
- **Artifacts:** see [[../workflow_state-execution]] frontmatter `closure_compare_l1b_first_pass` + `compare_cycle_l1b_tag`; validator reports under `roadmap_handoff_auto/*l1b*235200Z*`.

- **Queue dispatch:** `RESUME_ROADMAP` **`handoff-audit`** (`roadmap_track: execution`, **`pipeline_mode_used: balance`**, **`queue_next: true`**). **Post-l1b hygiene:** Phase **1** primary summary on this file aligns **`handoff_readiness` 87** on [[Execution/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture-Roadmap-2026-03-30-0430]] with execution-primary frontmatter; parallel spine mint-complete through **1.2.3**; **DEF-REG-CI** / **DEF-GMM-245** deferrals explicit in registry notes.
- **Fresh nested `roadmap_handoff_auto`:** Cursor **`Task(validator)` → `Task(internal-repair-agent)` → `Task(validator)`** **attempted** for a **new** first pass + compare second pass vs disk (operator: hostile evidence must not be stale vs **2026-04-10** post-bootstrap state).

- **Queue dispatch:** `RESUME_ROADMAP` **`handoff-audit`** (`roadmap_track: execution`, **`pipeline_mode_used: balance`**). Reasserted Phase **1** parallel-spine completeness (**1.1**/**1.2** + **1.1.1** + **1.2.1–1.2.3**) and pinned **`233000Z`** nested compare lineage ([[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-auto-exec-phase1-rollup-compare-next-20260408T233000Z-first-pass.md]] → [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-auto-exec-phase1-rollup-compare-next-20260408T233000Z-second-pass.md]]).
- **Fresh nested cycle:** **`Task(validator)` / `Task(internal-repair-agent)`** invocation **attempted** — host **did not expose** Cursor **`Task`** to this Layer 2 runtime → **no** new validator report paths; ledger records **`task_error`** (see roadmap Task return `nested_subagent_ledger`).
- **Authority unchanged:** `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true` — **no** closure flip until a pass returns **`log_only`** with **`missing_roll_up_gates`** / **`blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`** cleared (**operator `user_guidance`** + **## Phase 1 closure gate checklist**).
- **Next:** **Layer 1** post–little-val hostile **`roadmap_handoff_auto`** (sandbox lane) or explicit operator directive — **do not** suppress continuation churn solely via Layer 2 when **`Task`** is unavailable; prefer L1 compensating control.

- **Tuple authority unchanged:** `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true` — **no** closure flip until compare clears `missing_roll_up_gates` / `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`.

- Continuation of execution Phase 1 roll-up compare closure loop from origin `handoff-audit-repair-sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-20260408T124512Z`: Layer 2 re-audited parallel-spine trace (primary + secondaries **1.1**/**1.2** + tertiaries **1.1.1** + **1.2.1–1.2.3**), updated closure-evidence `repair_run_id_latest` on [[Execution/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture/Phase-1-Conceptual-Foundation-and-Core-Architecture-Roadmap-2026-03-30-0430#Handoff-audit closure evidence (execution)]], reaffirmed DEF evidence registry rows unchanged.
- **Nested helpers:** `Task(validator)` and `Task(internal-repair-agent)` were **not invocable** in this Layer 2 runtime — no new validator report paths from this run; canonical tuple remains **open** (`phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true`) until Layer 1 compare / post–little-val clears `missing_roll_up_gates` and `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit` per prior compare artifacts (e.g. [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-followup-handoff-audit-execution-rollup-closure-sandbox-20260408T120900Z-second-pass-20260408T121905Z]]).

### RESUME_ROADMAP deepen nested cycle (empty-queue bootstrap) — 2026-04-08T22:00Z — `empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T181500Z`

- **Nested `roadmap_handoff_auto`:** first pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-roadmap-handoff-auto-exec-empty-bootstrap-20260408T181500Z-20260408-validator-pass.md]] (`primary_code: missing_roll_up_gates`, `recommended_action: needs_work`, `severity: medium`).

- **Policy:** spine mint-complete through **1.2.3**; remaining blocker is **roll-up compare attestation** (`phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`), not missing execution nodes.
- **Scope:** `Roadmap/Execution/**` only; `parent_run_id: queue-eat-sandbox-20260408-layer1` \| `pipeline_mode_used: balance`.

- **Authority:** **`phase_1_rollup_closed` not flipped**; Phase 1 closure gate checklist rows for compare / `missing_roll_up_gates` remain **unchecked** until a pass returns `log_only` with blocker-family clear (per **## Phase 1 closure gate checklist** above).
- **Runtime:** this dispatch could not launch **fresh** nested `Task(validator)` / `Task(internal-repair-agent)` (host: Cursor `Task` tool not exposed to Layer 2 here) — **no duplicate** nested cycle; 22:00Z artifacts remain the authoritative compare lineage. Layer 1 post–little-val hostile **`roadmap_handoff_auto`** still applies when enabled.
- **Scope:** execution authority surfaces only; `parent_run_id: queue-eat-sandbox-20260408-layer1` \| `queue_lane: sandbox` \| `effective_track: execution`.

### Handoff-audit Layer2 nested cycle + IRA hygiene (execution) — 2026-04-08T21:00Z — `handoff-audit-repair-sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-20260408T130523Z`

- **Nested cycle:** first pass [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-handoff-audit-repair-20260408T130523Z-layer2-first-pass.md]] → IRA repair plan (`.technical/Internal-Repair-Agent/roadmap/2026-04/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-ira-call-1-handoff-audit-repair-20260408T130523Z.md`) → compare pass (second nested `Task(validator)` with `compare_to_report_path` = first pass).
- **Hygiene applied (vault):** aligned **`roadmap-state-execution`** frontmatter **`last_run`** to **2026-04-10T13:43:00Z**; superseded **D-Exec-1** live-cursor sentence for **`1.2.3`** post-mint spine; neutralized stale **Next** routing in **2026-04-08 14:05** expand row in [[workflow_state-execution]].
- **Policy:** `phase_1_rollup_closed` remains **`false`**; rollup closure still requires Layer 1 / compare to clear **`missing_roll_up_gates`** / **`blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`**.

### Handoff-audit repair compare hold (execution) — 2026-04-08T12:45Z — `handoff-audit-repair-sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-20260408T124512Z`

- Repair-class continuation run anchored to prior origin `handoff-audit-repair-sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-20260408T122234Z`; closure-evidence matrix and tuple authority re-asserted on execution surfaces without changing closure disposition.
- Canonical tuple remains intentionally open while blocker-family codes persist: `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true`; continuation must remain unsuppressed until compare validator clears both `missing_roll_up_gates` and `blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit`.
- Scope discipline maintained: execution authority surfaces only; no conceptual phase-note body edits; no queue mutation in Layer 2.

### Handoff-audit compare hold (execution) — 2026-04-08T11:33Z — `resume-handoff-audit-followup-exec-deepen-sandbox-20260408T113255Z`

- Re-ran execution Phase 1 roll-up handoff-audit closure check and verified compare report still returns `primary_code: missing_roll_up_gates` with `recommended_action: needs_work` and `regression_status: same` ([[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-genesis-mythos-master-followup-execution-deepen-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T164114Z-20260408T112212Z-compare-20260408T112501Z]]).
- Guidance applied: keep canonical tuple open while blocker-family codes persist. Authority remains `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `compare_validator_required: true`.
- Scope discipline: execution authority surfaces only; no conceptual phase-body edits and no queue mutation in Layer 2.

### RECAL-ROAD — 2026-04-08T15:26Z — `l1-a5b-repair-recal-sandbox-p121-20260408T152500Z` (historical, superseded)

- **Historical scope (superseded):** this pass corrected a then-stale `current_subphase_index` and intermediate gate wording before the tertiary chain was fully reconciled.
- **Current authority (superseding this historical row):** tertiary chain **1.2.1-1.2.3** is minted; Phase 1 primary roll-up remains **Open (advisory)** under tuple `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, and `compare_validator_required: true`.
- **Workflow log vs gate table (current):** no authority surface may claim `missing_execution_node_1_2_2`; closure remains attestation-gated only.
- **Validator lineage:** initial trigger cite remains [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-handoff-audit-exec-p121-20260408T152400Z.md]]; compare-regression repair tracked under `handoff-audit-repair-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T164114Z`.

### Handoff-audit attestation pending — 2026-04-08T08:05Z — `followup-deepen-exec-phase1-2-3-sandbox-20260408T080513Z`

- **Attestation state:** 1.2.3 mint complete; execution node blocker `missing_execution_node_1_2_3` cleared.
- **Canonical roll-up authority:** `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, `state: Open (advisory pending closure attestation)`.
- **Next required check:** run explicit `handoff-audit` compare pass and attach report reference before declaring Phase 1 primary roll-up closed.

### Handoff-audit closure evidence attached (pending compare) — 2026-04-08T09:08Z — `followup-handoff-audit-exec-phase1-rollup-sandbox-20260408T090832Z`

- **First validator pass:** [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-execution-followup-handoff-audit-exec-phase1-rollup-sandbox-20260408T090832Z]] (`primary_code: missing_roll_up_gates`, `recommended_action: needs_work`)
- **Compare validator pass:** [[3-Resources/Second-Brain/Validator-Reports/roadmap_handoff_auto/sandbox-execution-followup-handoff-audit-exec-phase1-rollup-sandbox-20260408T090832Z-compare-20260408T091940Z]] (`regression_status: same`, `reason_codes: [missing_roll_up_gates, blocker_tuple_still_open_explicit]`)
- **Canonical tuple policy (unchanged):** keep `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, keep `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`, keep `state: Open (advisory pending closure attestation)` until compare validator confirms closure with no execution_v1 blocker.

### Handoff-audit authority-surface reconciliation — 2026-04-08T16:41Z — `handoff-audit-repair-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T164114Z`

- **State-hygiene repair scope:** reconciled execution authority surfaces only (no conceptual body edits, no queue mutation): [[../roadmap-state]] `roadmap_track: execution`, [[../workflow_state]] conceptual advisory cursor note, [[../decisions-log]] conceptual autopilot repair spine, and this file’s Phase 1 roll-up tuple.
- **Authority outcome:** `authority_mode: execution_only`, `conceptual_cursor_authority: advisory_only`, `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`.
- **Lane + provenance:** `queue_lane: sandbox` \| `parallel_track: sandbox` \| `effective_track: execution` \| `queue_entry_id: handoff-audit-repair-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T164114Z`.

### Deepen stale-followup reconcile — 2026-04-08T16:42Z — `followup-execution-deepen-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T164114Z`

- **Resolution:** consumed a stale bootstrap-era `RESUME_ROADMAP` `deepen` follow-up after confirming active execution mirrors already include Phase 1 primary, secondary branches **1.1** and **1.2**, and tertiary chain **1.1.1** + **1.2.1-1.2.3** in the parallel spine.
- **Write discipline:** no remint, no flattening, no out-of-order phase creation; cursor stays at execution **`1.2.3`** and remains aligned with [[workflow_state-execution]].
- **Continuation:** keep canonical roll-up tuple (`phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`) and route next action to execution `handoff-audit` compare closure.

### HANDOFF_AUDIT_REPAIR — workflow log chronology — 2026-04-08T18:15Z — `handoff-audit-repair-empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T181500Z`

- **Issue:** provisional `state_hygiene_failure` from source `empty-bootstrap-sandbox-20260408T181500Z` — the corresponding ## Log data row had been appended **after** **2026-04-10** rows, breaking strict Timestamp monotonicity (contradicted sync-outputs claim of full chronological reorder).
- **Repair:** moved the **`2026-04-08 18:15`** row to correct order (**after** `2026-04-08 16:42`, **before** `2026-04-08 18:35`); updated row prose + [[workflow_state-execution]] frontmatter `last_handoff_audit_run_id`.
- **Authority unchanged:** `phase_1_rollup_closed: false`, `blocker_id: phase1_rollup_attestation_pending`; rollup closure still pending compare-attestation per execution policy.
- **Scope:** execution surfaces only; no prompt-queue mutation; `parent_run_id: eat-queue-sandbox-20260408-layer1`.
