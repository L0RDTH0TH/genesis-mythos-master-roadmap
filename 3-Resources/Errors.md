# Pipeline and Workflow Errors

Central log for **traced errors** from ingest, distill, archive, express, organize, and supporting workflows. Each error entry includes a trace (sanitized), summary (root cause, impact, suggested fixes, recovery), and optional link to pipeline-specific logs.

- **Dataview:** Query by table columns `pipeline`, `severity`, `approval`, `timestamp`, `error_type` (or `#review-needed` in text) to surface pending review or high-severity items.
- **Recovery:** Use RESTORE MODE to rollback from a per-change snapshot when documented in the entry.

## Error entry format

Each new error is appended as follows (no fenced YAML per entry):

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — Short Title
