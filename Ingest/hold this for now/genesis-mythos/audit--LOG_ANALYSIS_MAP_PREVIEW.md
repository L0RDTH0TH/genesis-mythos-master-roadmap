# Log Analysis: Map Preview Resize Issue

## Log File Location
- **Path:** `/home/darth/Documents/Mythos-gen/Final-Approach/mythos_log_2025-12-12.txt`
- **Size:** 396 lines
- **Last Entry:** 2025-12-12 21:17:54

## Key Findings

### 1. Map Generation Occurred
The log shows successful map generation at different sizes:
```
[2025-12-12 13:34:33] [UI/WorldBuilder] [INFO]: Generated procedural map [{"landmass":"Continents","size":"2048x2048","style":"High Fantasy"}]
[2025-12-12 13:36:54] [UI/WorldBuilder] [INFO]: Generated procedural map [{"landmass":"Continents","size":"4096x4096","style":"High Fantasy"}]
```

**Analysis:**
- Maps were generated at 2048x2048 and 4096x4096 sizes
- This confirms the `_generate_procedural_map()` function was called
- The `_update_2d_map_preview()` function should have been called after generation

### 2. No Diagnostic Output Found
**Critical Finding:** The diagnostic logging code added to `_update_2d_map_preview()` is **NOT present in the log file**.

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **Project Not Run Since Diagnostic Code Added**
   - The diagnostic code was added after the last run
   - The log entries are from runs before the diagnostic code was added
   - Latest log entry: 21:17:54 (before diagnostic code was added)

2. **Debug Logging Not Enabled**
   - Logger config shows `global_default_level: "VERBOSE"`
   - DEBUG level (3) should be logged since VERBOSE (4) > DEBUG (3)
   - However, "UI/WorldBuilder" system is not explicitly configured
   - Falls back to global default which is VERBOSE, so DEBUG should work

3. **Function Not Called**
   - `_update_2d_map_preview()` may not have been called
   - Or it was called but failed before reaching diagnostic code
   - No errors in log suggest function completed

4. **Logger System Issue**
   - The diagnostic code uses `Logger.debug("UI/WorldBuilder", ...)`
   - System name "UI/WorldBuilder" may not match Logger's system matching
   - Logger uses exact string matching: `system_levels.get(system, global_default_level)`

### 3. No Errors or Warnings
The log contains **NO errors or warnings** related to:
- TextureRect operations
- Texture assignment
- Layout calculations
- Map preview updates
- Expand mode issues

**This suggests:**
- The code executes without throwing errors
- The issue is a **silent failure** - code runs but doesn't produce expected visual result
- The problem is likely in layout/rendering, not in code execution

### 4. Logger Configuration Analysis

**Config File:** `config/logging_config.json`
```json
{
  "global_default_level": "VERBOSE",
  "systems": {
    "Logger": "VERBOSE",
    "Bootstrap": "VERBOSE"
  }
}
```

**Logger Behavior:**
- System "UI/WorldBuilder" is not in systems dictionary
- Falls back to `global_default_level: "VERBOSE"`
- DEBUG level (3) should be logged (VERBOSE (4) >= DEBUG (3))
- **But:** Logger uses exact string matching - "UI/WorldBuilder" must match exactly

**Potential Issue:**
- If Logger is looking for "UI" but code uses "UI/WorldBuilder", it may not match
- Need to verify Logger's system name matching logic

### 5. Missing Diagnostic Evidence

**What Should Be in Log (if diagnostic code ran):**
```
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: === MAP PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC START ===
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: New texture size [{"width":4096,"height":4096,...}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: BEFORE texture assignment [{"texture_rect_size":...,...}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: IMMEDIATELY AFTER texture assignment [{"texture_rect_size":...,...}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: AFTER mode changes [{"texture_rect_size":...,...}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: AFTER parent.update_minimum_size() [{"parent_size":...,...}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: AFTER LAYOUT COMPLETE [{"texture_rect_size":...,...}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [WARN]: ⚠️ ISSUE DETECTED: ... (if problems found)
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: === MAP PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC END ===
```

**What Is Actually in Log:**
- None of the above diagnostic messages
- Only the INFO level "Generated procedural map" message

## Conclusions

### Most Likely Scenario
1. **The diagnostic code was added AFTER the last project run**
2. **The log entries are from runs before diagnostic code existed**
3. **The project needs to be run again to generate diagnostic output**

### What This Means
- **Cannot identify the root cause from current log**
- **Need to run the project again with diagnostic code active**
- **The diagnostic code should produce output when:**
  - User changes world size
  - User clicks "Generate Map"
  - `_update_2d_map_preview()` is called

### Next Steps
1. **Run the project** with the diagnostic code in place
2. **Change world size** (e.g., Tiny → Large)
3. **Click "Generate Map"** to trigger map generation
4. **Check the log file** for diagnostic output
5. **Analyze the diagnostic data** to identify the root cause

### Alternative Investigation
If diagnostic code still doesn't produce output after running:
1. Check if `_update_2d_map_preview()` is actually being called
2. Verify Logger system name matching ("UI/WorldBuilder" vs "UI")
3. Add `print()` statements as fallback if Logger isn't working
4. Check Godot's built-in debug output for any errors

## Log File Summary
- **Total Entries:** 396 lines
- **Map Generation Events:** 2 (2048x2048 and 4096x4096)
- **Errors:** 0
- **Warnings:** 0
- **Diagnostic Messages:** 0 (expected - code added after last run)
- **Last Activity:** 2025-12-12 21:17:54
