# Final Transition Test Checklist

## Code Verification ✅

### 1. Legacy Handler Removed
- ✅ `_on_race_tab_completed()` function completely removed
- ✅ No references found in CharacterCreationRoot.gd

### 2. Direct Signal Connection
- ✅ RaceTab.tab_completed → TabNavigation.enable_next_tab() (line 96-97)
- ✅ Duplicate connection check in place

### 3. Debug Logging Added
- ✅ "enable_next_tab() called from tab_completed signal" (TabNavigation.gd:95)
- ✅ "About to emit tab_changed signal for: [tab]" (TabNavigation.gd:110)
- ✅ All fade animation logs in _load_tab()

## Expected Log Sequence

### Test 1: Race with No Subrace (e.g., Tiefling/Human)

**Action:** Select Tiefling → Click "Confirm Race →"

**Expected Logs (in order):**
1. `[INFO] RaceTab: Race confirmed (no subraces) - advancing to next tab`
2. `[DEBUG] enable_next_tab() called from tab_completed signal`
3. `[DEBUG] About to emit tab_changed signal for: Class`
4. `[DEBUG] TabNavigation: Auto-advanced to next tab: Class`
5. `[DEBUG] Tab changed to: Class`
6. `[DEBUG] Loading tab scene: Class`
7. `[DEBUG] Starting fade-out for old tab: RaceTab`
8. `[DEBUG] Fade-out complete for old tab`
9. `[DEBUG] Old tab removed from scene tree`
10. `[DEBUG] New tab created with alpha 0.0: ClassTab`
11. `[DEBUG] New tab added to scene tree`
12. `[DEBUG] Fade-in complete for new tab`
13. `[DEBUG] Tab transition complete: Class`

**Visual:** Smooth fade-out of RaceTab (0.15s) → fade-in of ClassTab (0.15s) = ~0.3s total

---

### Test 2: Race with Subrace (e.g., Elf → Wood Elf)

**Action:** Select Elf → Click "Confirm Race →" → Select Wood Elf → Click "Confirm Subrace →"

**Expected Logs (in order):**
1. `[INFO] RaceTab: Switched to subrace selection for Elf`
2. `[INFO] RaceTab: Subrace confirmed - advancing to next tab`
3. `[DEBUG] enable_next_tab() called from tab_completed signal`
4. `[DEBUG] About to emit tab_changed signal for: Class`
5. `[DEBUG] TabNavigation: Auto-advanced to next tab: Class`
6. `[DEBUG] Tab changed to: Class`
7. `[DEBUG] Loading tab scene: Class`
8. `[DEBUG] Starting fade-out for old tab: RaceTab`
9. `[DEBUG] Fade-out complete for old tab`
10. `[DEBUG] Old tab removed from scene tree`
11. `[DEBUG] New tab created with alpha 0.0: ClassTab`
12. `[DEBUG] New tab added to scene tree`
13. `[DEBUG] Fade-in complete for new tab`
14. `[DEBUG] Tab transition complete: Class`

**Visual:** Same smooth fade animation

## Critical Logs to Verify

These MUST appear for the fix to be confirmed:

1. ✅ `enable_next_tab() called from tab_completed signal`
2. ✅ `Tab changed to: Class`
3. ✅ `Starting fade-out for old tab: RaceTab`
4. ✅ `Fade-out complete for old tab`
5. ✅ `Fade-in complete for new tab`
6. ✅ `Tab transition complete: Class`

If ALL of these appear, the animated transition is working correctly!

## Failure Indicators

❌ **If you see:** Only "RaceTab: Subrace confirmed" but NO logs after
→ Signal connection failed

❌ **If you see:** "Tab changed to: Class" but NO "Starting fade-out"
→ _load_tab() not executing

❌ **If you see:** Instant tab switch with no fade
→ Animation logic bypassed

---

## Files Modified (Ready for Commit)

1. ✅ `scripts/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.gd`
2. ✅ `scripts/character_creation/tabs/TabNavigation.gd`

## Status

🟢 **READY FOR TESTING**

All code changes verified. Signal flow is correct. Animation logic is in place.
