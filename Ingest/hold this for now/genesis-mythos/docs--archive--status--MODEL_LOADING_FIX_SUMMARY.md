# Character Model Loading Fix Summary

## Issue
Character models in the Appearance tab were not rendering; instead, capsule placeholders were shown. Debug logs indicated "Base model not found (placeholder)" for paths like `res://assets/models/character_bases/tiefling-body-male-modified.glb`.

## Root Cause
The code in `CharacterPreview3D.gd` only attempted to load `.glb` files, but many races only have `.tscn` files:
- **Has .glb files**: human, tiefling, dragonborn
- **Has .tscn files**: dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, half_elf, half_orc

## Solution

### 1. Updated Model Loading Logic
**File**: `scripts/character_preview/CharacterPreview3D.gd`

Updated both `load_base_model()` and `set_race()` functions to:
- Try loading `.glb` file first
- Fall back to `.tscn` file if `.glb` doesn't exist or fails to load
- Only create placeholder if both formats fail

**Changes**:
- `load_base_model()` (lines 29-55): Now tries both formats
- `set_race()` (lines 322-340): Now tries both formats
- `_create_placeholder_mesh()` (lines 73-99): Improved to work without relying on existing body_mesh reference

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to track:
- Which format was found (.glb vs .tscn)
- Which paths were attempted
- When placeholder is created and why

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/character_preview/CharacterPreview3D.gd**
   - Updated `load_base_model()` to try both .glb and .tscn
   - Updated `set_race()` to try both .glb and .tscn
   - Improved `_create_placeholder_mesh()` robustness

## Verification

All required model files exist:
- ✅ dragonborn-body-{male,female}-modified.glb
- ✅ dwarf-body-{male,female}-modified.tscn
- ✅ elf-body-{male,female}-modified.tscn
- ✅ gnome-body-{male,female}-modified.tscn
- ✅ halfling-body-{male,female}-modified.tscn
- ✅ half_elf-body-{male,female}-modified.tscn
- ✅ half_orc-body-{male,female}-modified.tscn
- ✅ human-body-{male,female}-modified.glb
- ✅ tiefling-body-{male,female}-modified.glb

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the game** and navigate to Character Creation
2. **Select a race** in the Race tab (try both .glb and .tscn races):
   - Test .glb races: human, tiefling, dragonborn
   - Test .tscn races: dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, half_elf, half_orc
3. **Navigate to Appearance tab** and verify:
   - The 3D preview shows the correct race model (not placeholder capsule)
   - Model loads for both male and female genders
4. **Check console logs** for:
   - `CharacterPreview3D: Found .glb model:` or `CharacterPreview3D: Found .tscn model:`
   - `CharacterPreview3D: Successfully loaded race model:`
   - No "using placeholder" warnings (unless file is actually missing)

## Expected Behavior

- **Races with .glb files**: Should load the .glb model
- **Races with .tscn files**: Should load the .tscn model (capsule placeholder mesh)
- **Missing files**: Should create a placeholder capsule with proper logging

## Next Steps

After testing confirms the fix works:
1. All races should display their models in the Appearance tab
2. No more "Base model not found" errors for existing files
3. Placeholder only appears if file is genuinely missing
