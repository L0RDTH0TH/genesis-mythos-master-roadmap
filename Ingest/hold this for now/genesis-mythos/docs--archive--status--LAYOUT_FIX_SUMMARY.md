# LAYOUT FIX SUMMARY - ALL CHANGES APPLIED

## Fixes Applied Using MCP Actions

### ✅ Step 1: CurrentTabContainer (CharacterCreationRoot.tscn)
- **Location:** Line 89-92
- **Change:** Ensured Container mode with size_flags_vertical = 3 (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL)
- **Status:** ✅ Applied

### ✅ Step 2: center_area VBoxContainer (CharacterCreationRoot.tscn)  
- **Location:** Line 78-80
- **Change:** Added explicit size_flags_horizontal = 3, size_flags_vertical = 3
- **Status:** ✅ Applied

### ✅ Step 3: RaceGrid (RaceTab.tscn)
- **Location:** Line 73-78
- **Change:** Changed to Container mode, size_flags_vertical = 0 (shrink center)
- **Status:** ✅ Applied

### ✅ Step 4: RaceTab, MainPanel, UnifiedScroll
- **Status:** Already had correct settings - no changes needed

## Current Issue

The diagnostic still shows:
- **CurrentTabContainer:** height = 0
- **MarginContainer3:** height = 160 (only margins, no content space)

**Root cause:** MarginContainer3 calculates its size based on children. Since CurrentTabContainer has height = 0, MarginContainer3 only needs 160px (margins).

**This is a circular dependency:**
- CurrentTabContainer needs MarginContainer3 to have height > 160
- MarginContainer3 needs CurrentTabContainer to have height > 0

**Solution needed:** Break the cycle by ensuring MarginContainer3 expands independently, or give CurrentTabContainer a minimum height.

## Next Steps

The layout fixes are applied, but the circular dependency between MarginContainer3 and CurrentTabContainer needs to be resolved. This may require:

1. Setting a minimum height on CurrentTabContainer
2. Or ensuring MarginContainer3 expands to fill center_area regardless of child size
3. Or restructuring the layout to avoid the circular dependency
