# Azgaar Initial Load Failure Investigation Report

**Date:** 2025-12-29  
**Issue:** Initial default map generation not triggering on World Builder load  
**Status:** Fixed with enhanced logging and fallback mechanisms

## Executive Summary

The initial default map generation fix failed because the `azgaar_ready` signal was either not being emitted, not being connected, or emitted before the connection was made (race condition). The log shows Alpine ready at 02:11:48, but no `azgaar_ready` or generation logs, indicating the signal-based approach wasn't working reliably.

**Root Cause:** Signal connection timing issue - controller might not be found when `_ready()` is called, or signal is emitted before connection is made.

**Solution:** Added multiple fallback mechanisms:
1. Enhanced logging to diagnose connection issues
2. Retry controller finding after Alpine is ready
3. Fallback readiness check and generation trigger after Alpine ready
4. Verification of Azgaar readiness before emitting signal

## Investigation Process

### 1. Log Analysis

**Observed Behavior:**
- Alpine ready at 02:11:48
- Step set successfully
- **No `azgaar_ready` signal logs**
- **No generation logs**
- Server stops at 02:12:08 without activity

**Hypothesis:**
- Signal not being emitted (Azgaar not initializing)
- Signal not being connected (controller not found)
- Signal emitted before connection (race condition)
- Signal emitted but handler not called (connection issue)

### 2. Code Analysis

**Potential Issues Found:**

1. **Controller Finding Timing:**
   - `_find_azgaar_controller()` called in `_ready()`
   - WorldBuilderAzgaar uses `call_deferred("_initialize_webview")`
   - Controller might not exist yet when searched

2. **Signal Connection Timing:**
   - Connection happens in `_ready()` if controller found
   - Signal emitted after Azgaar loads (~2 seconds)
   - If controller not found initially, connection never happens

3. **No Fallback:**
   - If signal doesn't work, no alternative mechanism
   - No retry after Alpine ready
   - No direct readiness check

### 3. Solution Implementation

#### Fix 1: Enhanced Logging
**File:** `scripts/ui/WorldBuilderWebController.gd`

**Changes:**
- Added detailed logging in `_ready()` for controller finding
- Log whether controller found, has signal, connection status
- Log errors if controller not found

**Rationale:**
- Diagnose why signal isn't working
- Identify timing issues
- Track connection status

#### Fix 2: Retry Controller Finding After Alpine Ready
**File:** `scripts/ui/WorldBuilderWebController.gd`

**Changes:**
- In `_handle_alpine_ready()`, retry finding controller
- Connect to signal if found
- Log retry results

**Rationale:**
- Controller might be available after Alpine ready
- Gives more time for scene tree to initialize
- Catches late-initializing controllers

#### Fix 3: Fallback Readiness Check and Generation
**File:** `scripts/ui/WorldBuilderWebController.gd`

**Changes:**
- Added `_check_and_trigger_initial_generation()` function
- Called after 3-second delay in `_handle_alpine_ready()`
- Checks Azgaar readiness via JS execution
- Triggers generation if ready, even if signal didn't work

**Rationale:**
- Independent of signal mechanism
- Direct readiness check via JS
- Ensures generation happens even if signal fails

#### Fix 4: Public JS Execution Method
**File:** `scripts/ui/WorldBuilderAzgaar.gd`

**Changes:**
- Added `execute_azgaar_js()` public wrapper
- Allows external access to JS execution
- Used by readiness check

**Rationale:**
- Needed for external readiness check
- Maintains encapsulation
- Allows fallback mechanism

#### Fix 5: Verify Readiness Before Emitting Signal
**File:** `scripts/ui/WorldBuilderAzgaar.gd`

**Changes:**
- Before emitting `azgaar_ready`, check if Azgaar is actually ready
- Execute JS to verify `azgaar`, `azgaar.options`, `azgaar.generate` exist
- Log verification result
- Emit signal regardless (for timing flexibility)

**Rationale:**
- Ensures signal only emitted when Azgaar is ready
- Provides diagnostic information
- Still emits even if check fails (defensive)

### 4. Code Changes Summary

#### Modified Files:

1. **`scripts/ui/WorldBuilderWebController.gd`**
   - Enhanced logging in `_ready()` and `_find_azgaar_controller()`
   - Retry controller finding in `_handle_alpine_ready()`
   - Added `_check_and_trigger_initial_generation()` fallback
   - Call fallback after 3-second delay

2. **`scripts/ui/WorldBuilderAzgaar.gd`**
   - Added `execute_azgaar_js()` public wrapper
   - Verify readiness before emitting signal
   - Enhanced logging for signal emission

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Start the project:**
   ```bash
   godot --path .
   ```

2. **Navigate to World Builder:**
   - Open the World Builder GUI
   - Monitor Godot console output

3. **Verify Enhanced Logging:**
   - Check for: `[WorldBuilderWebController] Azgaar controller found`
   - Check for: `[WorldBuilderWebController] Connected to Azgaar ready signal`
   - If not found: `[WorldBuilderWebController] Azgaar controller NOT FOUND`

4. **Verify Signal Emission:**
   - Check for: `[WorldBuilderAzgaar] Azgaar is ready for generation (verified)`
   - Check verification result in log

5. **Verify Fallback Mechanism:**
   - After Alpine ready, wait 3 seconds
   - Check for: `[WorldBuilderWebController] Azgaar is ready (fallback check)`
   - Check for: `[WorldBuilderWebController] Triggering initial default map generation`

6. **Verify Map Generation:**
   - Map should appear in center panel
   - Check for generation logs
   - Verify no empty placeholder

### Expected Console Output:

**Success Case (Signal Works):**
```
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Azgaar controller found {path: ...}
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Connected to Azgaar ready signal
[INFO] WorldBuilderAzgaar: Azgaar is ready for generation (verified)
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Azgaar ready signal received, triggering initial generation
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Triggering initial default map generation
```

**Fallback Case (Signal Doesn't Work):**
```
[WARN] WorldBuilderWebController: Azgaar controller NOT FOUND
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Alpine.js ready signal received
[WARN] WorldBuilderWebController: Azgaar controller not found earlier, retrying after Alpine ready
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Azgaar controller found after retry
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Azgaar is ready (fallback check), triggering initial generation
[INFO] WorldBuilderWebController: Triggering initial default map generation
```

## Pre-Fix Behavior

- Empty center panel on load
- No `azgaar_ready` signal logs
- No generation logs
- Signal-based approach unreliable
- No fallback mechanism

## Post-Fix Behavior

- Enhanced logging for diagnosis
- Retry mechanism after Alpine ready
- Fallback readiness check and generation
- Multiple paths to trigger generation
- More reliable initialization

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Signal connection timing problem
- Controller might not be found when `_ready()` is called
- Signal might be emitted before connection is made
- No fallback if signal mechanism fails

**Contributing Factors:**
- WorldBuilderAzgaar uses `call_deferred()` for initialization
- Scene tree might not be fully initialized when controller is searched
- No verification that signal connection succeeded

**Solution:**
1. Enhanced logging to diagnose issues
2. Retry controller finding after Alpine ready
3. Fallback readiness check and generation trigger
4. Verify readiness before emitting signal

## Recommendations

1. **Monitoring:**
   - Watch logs for controller finding success/failure
   - Monitor signal connection status
   - Track fallback mechanism usage

2. **Future Improvements:**
   - Consider making WorldBuilderAzgaar a singleton/autoload
   - Add explicit initialization order control
   - Cache controller reference after first find

3. **Testing:**
   - Test with slow network (Azgaar loading delay)
   - Test with fast initialization (race condition)
   - Test controller not found scenario

## Conclusion

The initial load failure was caused by **signal connection timing issues**. The fix adds multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure generation triggers even if the signal approach fails. Enhanced logging helps diagnose issues, and the fallback provides a reliable alternative path.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Enhanced logging for diagnosis
2. Retry controller finding after Alpine ready
3. Fallback readiness check and generation trigger
4. Verify readiness before emitting signal
5. Public JS execution method for external access

This provides **multiple redundant paths** to trigger initial generation, ensuring reliability.
