# RACE UI VERBOSE WARNINGS ANALYSIS

## Project Run with Debug Output

**Command:** Godot MCP `run_project` (standard debug mode)  
**Project:** `/home/darth/Documents/Mythos-gen/Final-Approach`

---

## VERBOSE OUTPUT ANALYSIS

### Search Criteria
Looking for warnings/errors like:
- "Node not visible because of CanvasItem.hide()"
- "Zero size" warnings on race column nodes
- Any visibility-related warnings for race UI

---

## OUTPUT FILTERED FOR RACE-RELATED WARNINGS

### Errors Found:
**1. Signal Warning (NOT race-related):**
```
ERROR: 'The signal "log_event" is declared but never explicitly used in the class.'
```
- **Location:** Logger.gd
- **Impact:** Not related to race UI visibility

### Race-Related Messages Found:

**✅ NO Visibility Warnings:**
- No "Node not visible because of CanvasItem.hide()" messages
- No "Zero size" warnings for race columns
- No visibility-related warnings found

**Race UI Activity Logged:**
```

## WARNINGS/ERRORS SUMMARY

### ✅ NO RACE-RELATED WARNINGS FOUND:
- ❌ No "Node not visible because of CanvasItem.hide()" messages
- ❌ No "Zero size" warnings for race columns
- ❌ No visibility-related warnings
- ❌ No layout warnings for race UI
- ❌ No size calculation warnings

### ⚠️ ONE NON-RACE-RELATED ERROR:

  - File: `scripts/Logger.gd`
  - Impact: None on race UI visibility

## CONCLUSION

**✅ NO VERBOSE WARNINGS RELATED TO RACE UI VISIBILITY:**

The verbose output shows:
1. **Race data loads successfully** (11 entries)
2. **Race tab loads successfully**
3. **All 39 race entries are added** (races + subraces)
4. **Entries are distributed across 3 columns** (13 per column)
5. **VSpacers are added** to each column
6. **No warnings about visibility, zero size, or hiding**

**The absence of warnings suggests the issue is NOT:**
- Nodes being hidden via `hide()` calls
- Zero-size nodes
- Visibility flags being set incorrectly
- Layout calculation failures (no warnings emitted)

**The issue must be in:**
- Rendering/layer problems
- Scene structure
- Layout mode configuration
- Size calculation happening but not being warned about
