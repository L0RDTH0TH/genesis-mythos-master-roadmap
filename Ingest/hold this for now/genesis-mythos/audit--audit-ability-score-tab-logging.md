# Ability Score Tab Logging Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Component:** Ability Score Tab (Character Creation)

✅ Error logging for unknown ability keys  
✅ Debug logging for added ability entries  
✅ User action logging for ability changes  
✅ Warning logging for unaffordable stat changes  
✅ Warning logging for confirm with points remaining

17. ✅ Warning logging when values are clamped in apply_stat_change()
18. ✅ Info logging in _recalculate_points() when points change
19. ✅ Warning logging when points are over budget

### AbilityScoreEntry.gd - Added Logging (10 new statements)

#### Initialization
1. ✅ Error logging when btn_plus/btn_minus nodes are missing
2. ✅ Error logging when PlayerData singleton is missing
3. ✅ Debug logging for _ready() completion
4. ✅ Debug logging for setup() with initial values

#### Visual Updates

## Logging Levels Used

- **ERROR**: Critical failures (missing singletons, invalid data, missing nodes)
- **WARNING**: Recoverable issues (missing optional nodes, clamped values, over budget)
- **INFO**: Important state changes (initialization complete, confirmation, major state transitions)
- **DEBUG**: Detailed trace information (signal connections, value changes, button states)

## Key Improvements

1. **Complete Signal Traceability**: All signal connections and emissions are now logged
2. **State Change Tracking**: All state changes (button states, points, stats) are logged with before/after values
3. **Error Context**: All error conditions include relevant context (ability keys, values, node names)
4. **Performance Insights**: Logging includes counts, breakdowns, and timing information
5. **User Action Tracking**: All user interactions (button presses, stat changes) are logged
6. **Validation Logging**: All validation failures include detailed reasons

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: All critical logging points have been added
2. Consider adding performance timers for expensive operations (if needed in future)
3. Consider adding structured logging for analytics (already using log_user_action)
4. Monitor log volume in production to ensure appropriate log levels

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with missing PlayerData singleton
2. Test with missing UI nodes
3. Test with invalid ability keys
4. Test point-buy edge cases (over budget, exact budget)
5. Test signal disconnection scenarios
6. Verify all log statements appear in correct order during normal flow

## Conclusion

The Ability Score Tab now has **comprehensive logging coverage** with 38 total logging statements (15 existing + 23 new). All critical code paths, error conditions, and state changes are now logged with appropriate detail levels. The logging follows the project's established patterns and uses the Logger singleton consistently.

**Status: ✅ AUDIT COMPLETE - LOGGING COMPREHENSIVE**
