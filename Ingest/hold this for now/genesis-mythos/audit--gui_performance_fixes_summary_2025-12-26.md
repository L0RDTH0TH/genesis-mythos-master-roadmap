# GUI Performance Fixes Summary
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** Fixes Applied – Verification Recommended

---

## Fixes Applied

### Phase 1: Runtime Node Creation/Destruction (CRITICAL) ✅

**Problem:** `WorldBuilderUI._populate_params()` created and destroyed 18-30 Control nodes on every step change, causing 5-7 FPS performance degradation.

**Solution:**
- Created `ParameterRow.tscn` and `ParameterRow.gd` reusable component
- Implemented object pooling: Pre-create 30 parameter rows in `_ready()`
- Modified `_populate_params()` to reuse rows from pool instead of creating new ones
- Rows are hidden/shown and updated with new data instead of being destroyed

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/components/ParameterRow.tscn` (new)
- `ui/components/ParameterRow.gd` (new)
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.gd` (modified)

**Impact:** Eliminates runtime node creation/destruction, should restore 60+ FPS.

---

### Phase 2: Theme Overrides (HIGH) ✅

**Problem:** 20+ theme overrides in .tscn files and scripts breaking render batching.

**Solution:**
- Removed all `theme_override_*` properties from .tscn files
- Applied styling via `modulate` for dynamic colors (e.g., gold titles, step button highlights)
- Moved separation constants to scripts using `add_theme_constant_override()` (acceptable for container spacing)

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.tscn` (removed 14+ theme overrides)
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.gd` (added modulate for titles, moved separation to script)
- `scenes/MainMenu.tscn` (removed theme overrides)
- `scenes/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.tscn` (removed theme overrides)
- `ui/main_menu/main_menu_controller.gd` (added modulate for title)
- `scripts/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.gd` (added modulate for title)
- `ui/components/AbilityScoreRow.gd` (replaced theme override with modulate)

**Impact:** Improves render batching, reduces draw calls.

---

### Phase 3: Hard-Coded Sizes and Nesting Depth (MEDIUM) ✅

**Problem:** 30+ hard-coded sizes in .tscn files, nesting depth of 8 levels (exceeds 6-level limit).

**Solution:**
- Removed all `custom_minimum_size` with hard-coded Vector2 values from WorldBuilderUI.tscn
- Sizes are now applied via `_apply_ui_constants()` in script using UIConstants
- Flattened nesting depth by removing `GlobalControls` container (8→7 levels)

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.tscn` (removed 13+ hard-coded sizes, removed GlobalControls container)
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.gd` (updated node paths after flattening)

**Impact:** Better code maintainability, improved nesting (still 7 levels, but improved from 8).

---

## Remaining Issues

### Nesting Depth
- **Current:** 7 levels (WorldBuilderUI → MainVBox → MainHSplit → RightPanel → RightScroll → RightVBox → SeedHBox → SeedSpin)
- **Target:** 6 levels
- **Status:** Improved from 8 levels, but still 1 level over limit
- **Note:** Further flattening would require removing SeedHBox, which would break horizontal layout of SeedSpin and RandomizeBtn. This is acceptable as it's only 1 level over and the improvement is significant.

### Character Creation Tab Theme Overrides
- **Status:** Not yet fixed (lower priority)
- **Files:** All `scenes/character_creation/tabs/*.tscn` files still have theme overrides
- **Impact:** Low (these scenes are less frequently used)

---

## Verification Needed

### Runtime Metrics (Requires Testing)
1. **FPS:** Should be 60+ with WorldBuilderUI fully open
2. **CanvasItem Count:** Should be <600 (previously ~1514)
3. **Node Creation:** Verify no runtime node creation/destruction during step navigation

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate through all 8 steps in WorldBuilderUI
2. Verify parameter controls display correctly
3. Verify UI appearance (gold titles, button highlights)
4. Test window resize for responsiveness
5. Verify no performance degradation

---

## Files Created
- `ui/components/ParameterRow.tscn` - Reusable parameter row component
- `ui/components/ParameterRow.gd` - Parameter row logic with object pooling

## Files Modified
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.tscn` - Removed theme overrides, hard-coded sizes, flattened nesting
- `ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.gd` - Object pooling, modulate for styling, updated node paths
- `scenes/MainMenu.tscn` - Removed theme overrides
- `scenes/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.tscn` - Removed theme overrides
- `ui/main_menu/main_menu_controller.gd` - Added modulate for title
- `scripts/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.gd` - Added modulate for title
- `ui/components/AbilityScoreRow.gd` - Replaced theme override with modulate

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run project** and measure FPS/CanvasItem count with WorldBuilderUI active
2. **Test step navigation** to verify no runtime node creation
3. **Fix remaining character creation tab theme overrides** (if needed)
4. **Consider further nesting optimization** if 7 levels still causes issues (unlikely)
