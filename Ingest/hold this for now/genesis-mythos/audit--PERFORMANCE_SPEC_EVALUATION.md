# Performance Specification Evaluation Report
## Eryndor 4.0 – Performance Specification v1.0 (DRAFT)

**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Evaluator:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** EVALUATION COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

The proposed performance specification establishes **clear, enforceable guidelines** for maintaining 60 FPS and ensuring the PerformanceMonitor overlay remains responsive. The specification is **well-structured and aligned with Godot 4.5.1 best practices**, with some areas requiring refinement for implementation clarity and Godot-specific considerations.

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**

---

## 1. Core Principles Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Clear Goal Statement**
   - "PerformanceMonitor must never flatline" is a strong, testable requirement
   - Aligns with project goal: "Maintain 60 FPS on mid-range hardware"

2. **Practical Budget Framework**
   - 16 ms per-frame budget is standard (60 FPS = 16.67 ms)
   - Category-specific budgets (5 ms world gen, 10 ms map loading) are reasonable starting points

3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**
   - Block detection in PerformanceMonitor is **feasible and high-value**
   - Data-driven budgets via JSON align with project's "100% data-driven" philosophy

### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Main Thread vs. Render Thread**
   - Specification doesn't clearly distinguish between:
     - `_process()` time (main thread CPU)
     - Rendering time (GPU/render thread)
   - Godot's `Performance.TIME_PROCESS` includes `_process()` calls but rendering is separate
   - **Recommendation:** Clarify that 16 ms budget applies to **main thread CPU time**, not GPU rendering

2. **Godot-Specific Timing Constraints**
   - In Godot, `_process(delta)` delta may exceed 16 ms during frame drops, but this is a **result** of blocking, not a direct measurement
   - `Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_PROCESS)` is cumulative across all nodes
   - **Recommendation:** Track delta time between consecutive `_process()` calls in PerformanceMonitor to detect actual stalls

---

## 2. Performance Categories Analysis

### Category Budgets Review

| Category | Spec Budget | Assessment | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **World Generation** | ≤ 5 ms | ✅ **REASONABLE** | Already threaded; budget applies to main-thread overhead |
| **Map Loading/Unloading** | ≤ 10 ms | ⚠️ **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** | Loading can spike on first load; distinguish initial vs. incremental |
| **AI / Pathfinding** | ≤ 8 ms | ✅ **REASONABLE** | Per-frame budget is appropriate for incremental pathfinding |
| **Save / Load** | ≤ 20 ms (one-time) | ✅ **APPROVED** | One-time operations can exceed frame budget |
| **Procedural Asset Gen** | ≤ 5 ms | ⚠️ **CONSIDER LOWER** | If threaded, main-thread overhead should be < 2 ms |
| **Rendering / Culling** | ≤ 12 ms (render thread) | ⚠️ **GODOT HANDLES** | This is GPU time; Godot manages automatically |
| **UI Updates** | ≤ 5 ms | ✅ **REASONABLE** | Aligns with existing performance audits |

### ⚠️ Missing Categories

Consider adding:
- **Physics Processing** (`_physics_process()`) – already tracked in PerformanceMonitor
- **Network Updates** (future multiplayer) – should be < 5 ms per frame
- **Audio Processing** – typically < 1 ms but worth tracking

---

## 3. Enforcement Mechanisms Evaluation

### 3.1 Main Thread Block Detector

**Proposed Implementation:**
- Track delta between consecutive `_process()` calls
- If delta > 50 ms → flash red warning in DETAILED mode
- Log to console with stack trace

**Assessment:** ✅ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

**Implementation Notes:**

1. **Delta Tracking Method**
   ```gdscript
   # In PerformanceMonitor.gd
   var _last_process_time: int = 0
   var _frame_delta_history: Array[float] = []
   
   func _process(_delta: float) -> void:
       var current_time: int = Time.get_ticks_usec()
       if _last_process_time > 0:
           var actual_delta_ms: float = (current_time - _last_process_time) / 1000.0
           _frame_delta_history.append(actual_delta_ms)
           if actual_delta_ms > 50.0:  # Block detected
               _on_block_detected(actual_delta_ms)
       _last_process_time = current_time
       # ... existing update code ...
   ```

2. **Warning Display**
   - Add `Label` to PerformanceMonitor UI: `block_warning_label`
   - Flash red background when block detected
   - Show for 2-3 seconds, then fade out
   - Format: `"⚠️ BLOCK: %.1f ms" % block_time_ms`

3. **Stack Trace Logging**
   - Use `print_stack()` in DETAILED mode only (expensive)
   - Or log caller info via `get_stack()` (lighter weight)

### 3.2 Long Frame History Graph

**Proposed:** Purple graph line showing per-frame total time

**Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED**

**Implementation:**
- Add `frame_time_graph: GraphControl` to bottom graph bar
- Track `Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_PROCESS) * 1000.0` as total frame time
- Color: `Color(0.8, 0.2, 1.0)` (purple)
- Max value: 33.33 ms (aligns with existing bottom graphs)

### 3.3 Status Text Enhancement

**Proposed:** "Heavy Operation Active" when threaded tasks are running

**Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED** (Partially Implemented)

**Current State:**
- `system_status_label` already exists and shows "World Gen Active"
- Thread metrics are already tracked via `_update_thread_metrics()`

**Recommendation:**
- Expand to cover all threaded operations:
  - "World Gen Active"
  - "Map Loading Active"
  - "Asset Generation Active"
  - "Save/Load Active"
- Use a registry pattern: `ThreadedTaskRegistry.register_task(task_name)` / `unregister_task(task_name)`

---

## 4. Code Review Rules Assessment

### Proposed Rules #10 & #11

**Rule #10:** "No operation exceeding 16 ms budgeted time may run synchronously on the main thread."

**Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED** (with clarification)

**Considerations:**
1. **Practical Enforcement:** Code review is primary enforcement; runtime detection is secondary
2. **Exception Cases:** Initial scene load, first-time asset compilation may legitimately exceed budget
3. **Documentation:** Add to project rules with examples:
   ```gdscript
   # ❌ BAD: Synchronous heavy compute
   func generate_world():
       _heavy_computation()  # Blocks main thread
   
   # ✅ GOOD: Threaded heavy compute
   func generate_world():
       generation_thread = Thread.new()
       generation_thread.start(_heavy_computation)
   ```

**Rule #11:** "All loading/procedural screens must display a theme-compliant ProgressBar and feed progress to PerformanceMonitor."

**Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED** (with UI spec alignment)

**Considerations:**
1. **UIConstants Integration:** Use `UIConstants.PROGRESS_BAR_WIDTH` / `PROGRESS_BAR_HEIGHT`
2. **PerformanceMonitor API:** Add `set_progress(operation: String, percent: float)` method
3. **Existing Implementation:** WorldGenerator already emits `progress_update` signal – connect to PerformanceMonitor

---

## 5. Data-Driven Performance Budgets

### Proposed Structure: `res://data/performance_budgets.json`

**Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED** (with enhancements)

**Recommended Structure:**
```json
{
  "world_generation": {
    "threaded": true,
    "max_main_thread_per_frame_ms": 5.0,
    "description": "World generation must run in thread; main thread only handles progress/status updates"
  },
  "map_loading": {
    "threaded": true,
    "chunk_size_tiles": 4096,
    "max_main_thread_per_frame_ms": 10.0,
    "allow_spikes_on_initial_load": true,
    "description": "Map loading uses chunked streaming; initial load may spike"
  },
  "ai_thinking": {
    "threaded": false,
    "max_main_thread_per_frame_ms": 8.0,
    "incremental": true,
    "description": "AI uses incremental processing per frame"
  },
  "save_load": {
    "threaded": true,
    "max_one_time_ms": 20.0,
    "description": "Save/load operations are one-time and can exceed frame budget"
  },
  "procedural_asset_gen": {
    "threaded": true,
    "max_main_thread_per_frame_ms": 5.0,
    "description": "Heightmaps, meshes, textures generated off-main"
  },
  "ui_updates": {
    "threaded": false,
    "max_main_thread_per_frame_ms": 5.0,
    "lazy_updates": true,
    "description": "UI updates must use lazy updates; no heavy logic in _process"
  }
}
```

**Implementation Considerations:**
1. **Load at Startup:** Create `PerformanceBudgetManager` singleton (optional; can be loaded on-demand)
2. **Runtime Validation:** Systems can query budgets before operations
3. **Modding Support:** JSON allows easy tweaking without code changes

---

## 6. Development Workflow Assessment

### Proposed Workflow

**After any major feature:** Run with PerformanceMonitor in DETAILED mode → verify no red warnings

**Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED**

**Enhancement Recommendations:**

1. **Automated Testing Integration**
   - Add GUT test: `test_performance_monitor_responsiveness()`
   - Verify PerformanceMonitor updates even during heavy operations
   - Test block detection triggers correctly

2. **Pre-Commit Hook** (Future)
   - Optional script to run performance audit before commit
   - Flags files with synchronous heavy compute patterns

3. **CI/CD Integration** (Future)
   - Automated performance regression testing
   - Compare frame times across commits

---

## 7. Godot 4.5.1 Specific Considerations

### 7.1 Threading Limitations

**Godot Threading Facts:**
- `Thread` class is available and stable
- `WorkerThreadPool` exists but is less commonly used
- Threads cannot access Godot nodes/resources directly (must use `call_deferred`)

**Recommendation:** Clarify in spec that threading implementations must use `call_deferred` for main-thread callbacks.

### 7.2 Performance Monitor API

**Current Usage:**
- `Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_PROCESS)` – cumulative across all nodes
- `Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_PHYSICS_PROCESS)` – physics time
- `RenderingServer.get_rendering_info()` – GPU metrics

**Recommendation:** Add note that `TIME_PROCESS` includes all `_process()` calls; individual node timing requires manual instrumentation.

### 7.3 Frame Delta Accuracy

**Consideration:** `_process(delta)` delta is clamped and may not reflect actual wall-clock time during stalls.

**Recommendation:** Use `Time.get_ticks_usec()` for block detection, not `delta` parameter.

---

## 8. Implementation Priority & Roadmap

### Phase 1: High-Value, Low-Risk (Immediate)

1. **Main Thread Block Detector** ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - Small code change (~50 lines)
   - Immediate visibility into blocking issues
   - No risk to existing systems

2. **Long Frame History Graph** ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Visualizes frame time trends
   - Complements block detector
   - Low implementation risk

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Next Sprint)

3. **Performance Budgets JSON**
   - Create `res://data/performance_budgets.json`
   - Document current system budgets
   - Enable future runtime validation

4. **Status Text Enhancement**
   - Expand `system_status_label` to cover all threaded operations
   - Add `ThreadedTaskRegistry` for centralized tracking

### Phase 3: Enforcement (Future)

5. **Code Review Rules Integration**
   - Add rules #10 & #11 to project-rules.mdc
   - Update developer documentation
   - Create code review checklist

6. **Automated Testing**
   - GUT tests for PerformanceMonitor responsiveness
   - Integration tests for threaded operations

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: False Positives in Block Detection

**Risk:** Block detector may trigger during legitimate frame drops (e.g., garbage collection, OS interrupts)

**Mitigation:**
- Use threshold of 50 ms (as specified) – high enough to avoid noise
- Add smoothing: Only warn if 3+ consecutive frames exceed threshold
- Allow manual suppression in DETAILED mode (debug flag)

### Risk 2: Performance Budget Enforcement Overhead

**Risk:** Runtime budget checking adds overhead

**Mitigation:**
- Budgets are JSON config (no runtime overhead unless queried)
- Runtime validation is optional (development/debug mode only)
- Primary enforcement is code review, not runtime checks

### Risk 3: Threading Complexity

**Risk:** Over-aggressive threading can complicate debugging and introduce race conditions

**Mitigation:**
- Start with existing threaded systems (WorldGenerator is already threaded)
- Document threading patterns in codebase
- Use mutexes for shared state (already done in WorldGenerator)
