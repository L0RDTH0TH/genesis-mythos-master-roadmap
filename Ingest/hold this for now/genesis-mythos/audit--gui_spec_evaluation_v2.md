| Theme override inconsistency | ✅ Section 2.3: Override documentation | **Excellent** |

**Strengths:**
- GameGUI integration provides advanced scaling solutions
- UIConstants table is clear and actionable
- Migration plan addresses the 50+ instances in WorldBuilderUI.gd

---

### 3. Project Rules Compliance ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.5/5)

**Grade: A**

**Excellent Alignment:**
- ✅ Follows project rules format perfectly
- ✅ References `bg3_theme.tres` correctly
- ✅ Enforces typed GDScript
- ✅ Maintains folder structure compliance
- ✅ Includes prompt format for Grok/Cursor
- ✅ GameGUI already installed (verified in addons/)

**Minor Issues:**

1. **UIConstants Location:**
   - Spec mentions "UIConstants.gd" but doesn't specify exact path
   - **Recommendation:** Add: `res://scripts/ui/UIConstants.gd` (matches project structure)
   - **Current Status:** Not critical, but should be explicit

2. **GameGUI Node Naming:**
   - Spec uses "GGHBoxContainer" but actual nodes are "GGHBox" and "GGVBox"
   - **Examples:**
     - Spec says: `GGHBoxContainer` / `GGVBoxContainer`
     - Actual nodes: `GGHBox` / `GGVBox` (verified in plugin.gd)
   - **Recommendation:** Correct to match actual node names, or clarify both are acceptable

3. **Autoload vs. Class:**
   - Still not explicitly stated (though table format suggests class_name)
   - **Recommendation:** Add one line: "UIConstants.gd uses `class_name UIConstants` (not autoload)"

---

### 4. Completeness ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Grade: A+**

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
- ✅ Philosophy and principles (Section 1)
- ✅ Structural guidelines (Section 2.1-2.8)
- ✅ Theme integration (Section 2.3)
- ✅ Character creation specifics (Section 2.4)
- ✅ World generation specifics (Section 2.5)
- ✅ Performance considerations (Section 2.6)
- ✅ Accessibility (Section 2.7) - **NEW**
- ✅ Error handling (Section 2.8) - **NEW**
- ✅ GameGUI integration (Section 3) - **NEW**
- ✅ Project settings (Section 4) - **NEW**
- ✅ Implementation workflow (Section 5)
- ✅ Migration plan (Section 6) - **ENHANCED**
- ✅ UI change checklist (Section 7) - **NEW**

**Excellent:** All previously missing sections have been added.

---

### 5. Technical Accuracy ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.5/5)

**Grade: A**

**Mostly Correct:**
- ✅ Viewport sizing example fixed
- ✅ Anchor presets usage correct
- ✅ Container types accurate
- ✅ Size flags correct
- ✅ Theme integration accurate
- ✅ Project settings exact values provided

**Needs Clarification:**

1. **GameGUI Node Names:**
   - **Issue:** Spec uses "GGHBoxContainer" but actual nodes are "GGHBox"
   - **Evidence:** `addons/GameGUI/plugin.gd` shows: `GGHBox`, `GGVBox` (not Container suffix)
   - **Impact:** Low - developers will discover this quickly, but should be corrected
   - **Recommendation:** Update spec to use actual node names: `GGHBox`, `GGVBox`, `GGLabel`, etc.

2. **GGContainer Reference:**
   - Spec mentions "GGContainer" but actual base class is "GGComponent"
   - **Recommendation:** Clarify: Use `GGComponent` as base, or specific nodes like `GGMarginLayout`

3. **Stretch Mode Settings:**
   - Section 4 provides exact values - **Excellent**
   - But `scale_mode = "fractional"` might need clarification if not standard
   - **Recommendation:** Verify this is a valid Godot 4.5.1 setting, or use `"viewport"` if fractional doesn't exist

---

### 6. GameGUI Integration Assessment ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Grade: A+**

**Excellent Integration:**
- ✅ GameGUI is already installed (verified in `addons/GameGUI/`)
- ✅ Addon usage guide already documents GameGUI (`.cursor/rules/godot-addon-usage-guide.md`)
- ✅ Spec provides clear rationale (Section 3)
- ✅ Hybrid approach (GameGUI + built-in containers) is sensible
- ✅ Migration plan accounts for GameGUI adoption

**Strengths:**
- Addresses audit issues (clipping, scaling) directly
- Compatible with existing theme system
- Phased migration reduces risk

**Minor Note:**
- Spec says "mandatory addon" but addon guide says "optional/replaceable"
- **Recommendation:** Align language: "Primary tool for complex menus" rather than "mandatory"

---

### 7. Clarity & Structure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Grade: A+**

**Excellent:**
- ✅ Clear hierarchy (philosophy → guidelines → specifics)
- ✅ Well-organized sections with logical flow
- ✅ Matches project rules format perfectly
- ✅ Includes code examples
- ✅ Actionable recommendations
- ✅ **UIConstants table is excellent** - clear and comprehensive

**Improvements from v1:**
- Table format for UIConstants is much clearer
- Migration plan is detailed and phased
- Checklist provides quick reference

---

### 8. Practicality & Implementability ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Grade: A+**

**Very Practical:**
- ✅ Specific file paths (mostly)
- ✅ Concrete code examples
- ✅ Detailed migration plan with phases
- ✅ Implementation workflow defined
- ✅ UI change checklist for validation

**Strengths:**
- Phased migration reduces risk
- "One scene at a time" rule is sensible
- Testing after each phase prevents regression

**Minor Suggestions:**
1. Add estimated time per phase (e.g., "Phase 1: 2-4 hours")
2. Add rollback strategy if migration fails

---

### 9. Best Practices Alignment ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Grade: A+**

**Excellent:**
- ✅ Follows Godot 4 documentation patterns
- ✅ Aligns with AAA RPG design principles
- ✅ Emphasizes data-driven approach
- ✅ Includes performance considerations
- ✅ Responsive design principles
- ✅ Accessibility standards
- ✅ Error handling patterns

**Well Done:**
- Container-first approach
- Theme-driven styling
- No magic numbers
- Explicit size flags
- GameGUI for advanced scaling

## Specific Recommendations

### High Priority (Should Address Before Integration)

1. **Fix GameGUI Node Names:**
   ```gdscript
   # Current spec says:
   GGHBoxContainer, GGVBoxContainer
   
   # Should be:
   GGHBox, GGVBox  # (matches actual node names)
   ```

2. **Specify UIConstants Path:**
   ```gdscript
   # Add to Section 2.2:
   UIConstants.gd location: res://scripts/ui/UIConstants.gd
   Implementation: class_name UIConstants (not autoload)
   ```

3. **Clarify GGContainer:**
   - Replace "GGContainer" references with actual node names
   - Or clarify: "Use GGComponent-derived nodes like GGMarginLayout"

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

4. **Add UIConstants.gd Template:**
   - Provide complete file template in spec or separate file
   - Include all constants from the table

5. **Verify Project Settings:**
   - Test `scale_mode = "fractional"` in Godot 4.5.1
   - Confirm it's a valid setting or provide alternative

6. **Align Addon Language:**
   - Change "mandatory addon" to "primary tool" to match addon guide

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)

7. **Add Visual Examples:**
   - Screenshot annotations showing before/after migration
   - Scene tree diagrams

8. **Add Troubleshooting:**
   - Common GameGUI issues
   - Migration pitfalls
