# FORENSIC DEBUG - COMPLETE ANSWERS TO ALL 11 QUESTIONS

## RUNTIME DATA CAPTURED VIA MCP TOOLS

All answers below are from live runtime inspection while the game was running.

---

### 1. EXACT NODE THAT SHOULD DISPLAY THE RACE COLUMNS

**Full node path:** `RaceTab/MainPanel/UnifiedScroll/RaceGrid`

**Exact node type:** `GridContainer`

**Name in scene tree:** `RaceGrid`

---

### 2. RUNTIME GEOMETRY (Remote tab → select the column node)

- **global_position:** `(380, 120)`
- **position:** `(0, 0)`
- **size:** `(1227, 1036)` ✅ **Valid size!**
- **rect_min_size (custom_minimum_size):** `(0, 0)`

**Analysis:** Size is **NOT** zero or ridiculously small. RaceGrid has a valid size of 1227x1036 pixels.

---

### 3. PARENT CHAIN GEOMETRY (same Remote tab, one by one going up)

**Parent hierarchy with sizes:**

| Level | Node | Type | Size | Status |
|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | UnifiedScroll | ScrollContainer | (1235, **0**) | 🔴 **HEIGHT = 0!** |
| 2 | MainPanel | Panel | (1235, **0**) | 🔴 **HEIGHT = 0!** |
| 3 | RaceTab | Control | (1235, **0**) | 🔴 **HEIGHT = 0!** |
| 4 | CurrentTabContainer | Control | (1235, **0**) | 🔴 **HEIGHT = 0!** |
| 5 | MarginContainer3 | MarginContainer | (1355, 160) | ✅ Valid |
| 6 | center_area | VBoxContainer | (1355, 1080) | ✅ Valid |
| 7 | MarginContainer2 | MarginContainer | (1355, 1080) | ✅ Valid |
| 8 | MainHBox | HBoxContainer | (2095, 1080) | ✅ Valid |
| 9 | CharacterCreationRoot | Control | (2095, 1080) | ✅ Valid |

**🚨 CRITICAL FINDING:** 
- **UnifiedScroll** (ScrollContainer) has **height = 0**
- **MainPanel** has **height = 0**
- **RaceTab** has **height = 0**

Even though RaceGrid has a valid size (1227, 1036), its parent **UnifiedScroll** has height 0, meaning the ScrollContainer cannot display its contents!

---

### 4. LAYOUT & SIZING FLAGS RIGHT NOW (live values)

**RaceGrid:**
- `size_flags_horizontal: 3` (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL) ✅
- `size_flags_vertical: 3` (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL) ✅
- `anchors_preset: 0` (not using anchors)
- `layout_mode: 2` (Container mode)

**Direct Parent (UnifiedScroll):**
- `size_flags_horizontal: 3` (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL) ✅
- `size_flags_vertical: 3` (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL) ✅
- `anchors_preset: 15` (Full Rect)

**Grand-parent (MainPanel):**
- `size_flags_horizontal: 3` (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL) ✅
- `size_flags_vertical: 3` (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL) ✅

**Analysis:** All size flags are correct (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL = 3), but the parent containers have zero height.

---

### 5. GRIDCONTAINER-SPECIFIC LIVE VALUES (if it's a GridContainer)

- **columns property:** `4` ✅
- **separation_horizontal:** `4` (from theme)
- **separation_vertical:** `4` (from theme)
- **custom_minimum_size (live):** `(0, 0)`
- **Number of child nodes:** `39` ✅

**Analysis:** GridContainer is properly configured with 4 columns and has 39 children.

---

### 6. CHILD NODES INSIDE THE COLUMN CONTAINER

- **Number of direct children:** `39` ✅

**First child (RaceEntry):**
- **size:** `(304, 100)` ✅ Valid size
- **visible:** `true` ✅
- **modulate:** `(1, 1, 1, 1)` ✅ Fully opaque
- **self_modulate:** `(1, 1, 1, 1)` ✅ Fully opaque
- **type:** `PanelContainer`
- **StyleBox bg_color:** `(0.15, 0.09, 0.05, 1)` with **alpha: 1.000000** ✅ Fully opaque

**Analysis:** Children are properly sized and visible. No transparency issues.

---

### 7. VISIBILITY CHAIN

Starting from RaceGrid going up to root:

| Level | Node | Visible |
|-------|------|---------|
| 0 | RaceGrid | ✅ **true** |
| 1 | UnifiedScroll | ✅ **true** |
| 2 | MainPanel | ✅ **true** |
| 3 | RaceTab | ✅ **true** |
| 4 | CurrentTabContainer | ✅ **true** |
| 5 | MarginContainer3 | ✅ **true** |
| 6 | center_area | ✅ **true** |
| 7 | MarginContainer2 | ✅ **true** |
| 8 | MainHBox | ✅ **true** |
| 9 | CharacterCreationRoot | ✅ **true** |

**Analysis:** ✅ **ALL nodes are visible**. No visibility issues in the chain.

---

### 8. THEME OVERRIDES AT RUNTIME

**RaceGrid:**
- Has theme: **no** (inherits from parent)

**First child (RaceEntry):**
- **StyleBox bg_color:** `(0.15, 0.09, 0.05, 1)` 
- **Alpha:** `1.000000` ✅ Fully opaque

**Analysis:** ✅ No transparent StyleBoxes. All alpha values are 1.0.

---

### 9. CLIPPING & MASKING

Clip Contents checkbox status up the chain:

| Level | Node | Clip Contents |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 0 | RaceGrid | ✅ **false** |
| 1 | UnifiedScroll | ⚠️ **true** (normal for ScrollContainer) |
| 2 | MainPanel | ✅ **false** |
| 3 | RaceTab | ✅ **false** |
| 4 | CurrentTabContainer | ✅ **false** |
| 5 | MarginContainer3 | ✅ **false** |
| 6 | center_area | ✅ **false** |
| 7 | MarginContainer2 | ✅ **false** |
| 8 | MainHBox | ✅ **false** |
| 9 | CharacterCreationRoot | ✅ **false** |

**Analysis:** ✅ Only UnifiedScroll has clip_contents = true, which is normal for ScrollContainers. No unexpected clipping.

---

### 10. QUICK TEST - MANUAL SIZE SET

**Test performed:**
- **Original size:** `(1227, 1036)`
- **Set size to:** `Vector2(800, 600)`
- **After setting, actual size:** `(800, 1036)` - Width changed, height stayed at 1036
- **After 2 frames:** Size reverted to `(1227, 1036)` (layout system reset it)
- **Child count:** `39` ✅

**Analysis:** The size can be set, but the layout system immediately resets it. This suggests the layout constraints are working, but something is preventing the parent from having proper height.

---

### 11. BONUS BRUTAL TEST - RED MODULATE

**Test performed:**
- **Original modulate:** `(1, 1, 1, 1)`
- **Set modulate to:** `Color(1, 0, 0, 1)` - BRIGHT RED
- **After red modulate:** `size: (1227, 1036), visible: true`

**Visual check needed:** Check if a red rectangle appears on screen. If yes, the grid is there but something else is wrong. If no, the grid is not being rendered.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### THE PROBLEM:

**UnifiedScroll (ScrollContainer) has height = 0**

Even though:
- ✅ RaceGrid has valid size (1227, 1036)
- ✅ RaceGrid has 39 children properly sized
- ✅ All size flags are correct (SIZE_EXPAND_FILL)
- ✅ All nodes are visible
- ✅ No clipping issues
- ✅ No transparency issues

**The ScrollContainer parent cannot display content because it has zero height!**

---

## WHY THIS HAPPENS

Looking at the parent chain:
- `RaceTab` has height 0
- `MainPanel` (parent of UnifiedScroll) has height 0
- `UnifiedScroll` (ScrollContainer) has height 0

The ScrollContainer's height depends on its parent's size. Since `MainPanel` has height 0, `UnifiedScroll` also gets height 0, and cannot display its child `RaceGrid` even though RaceGrid has valid content.

---

## THE FIX NEEDED

The issue is in the **scene file layout configuration**. The `RaceTab`, `MainPanel`, or `UnifiedScroll` needs to properly expand to fill vertical space.

**Likely causes:**
1. Missing or incorrect `size_flags_vertical` on MainPanel
2. Missing or incorrect anchors/layout mode on UnifiedScroll
3. Parent container not properly sized

**Next step:** Inspect `RaceTab.tscn` to see why MainPanel and UnifiedScroll are getting zero height instead of expanding to fill available space.

---

## SUMMARY

**All 11 questions answered with exact runtime values.**

**Root cause:** UnifiedScroll (ScrollContainer) has height = 0 because its parent MainPanel has height = 0, preventing the grid from being displayed even though RaceGrid itself is properly configured with valid content.
