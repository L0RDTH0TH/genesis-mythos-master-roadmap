# Latest Log Analysis: Map Preview Diagnostic Status

## Log File Status
- **File:** `/home/darth/Documents/Mythos-gen/Final-Approach/mythos_log_2025-12-12.txt`
- **Size:** 442 lines (increased from 396)
- **Last Modified:** 2025-12-12 21:24:46
- **Latest Run:** 2025-12-12 21:24:00 - 21:24:46

## Key Findings

### 1. Diagnostic Code is Present ✅
The diagnostic code exists in `WorldBuilderUI.gd`:
- Line 1643: `Logger.debug("UI/WorldBuilder", "=== MAP PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC START ===")`
- Line 1711: `call_deferred("_diagnostic_check_texture_rect_after_layout", ...)`
- Line 1723: `func _diagnostic_check_texture_rect_after_layout(...)`
- Line 1781: `Logger.debug("UI/WorldBuilder", "=== MAP PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC END ===")`

### 2. No Diagnostic Output in Latest Run ❌
**Critical Finding:** The latest run (21:24) shows:
- ✅ UI initialized successfully
- ✅ "Wizard-style UI ready" logged
- ❌ **NO map generation occurred**
- ❌ **NO diagnostic output**

### 3. Last Map Generation
The last map generation in the log was:
```
[2025-12-12 13:36:54] [UI/WorldBuilder] [INFO]: Generated procedural map [{"landmass":"Continents","size":"4096x4096","style":"High Fantasy"}]
```

**This was BEFORE the diagnostic code was added.**

### 4. What This Means

**Scenario 1: User Didn't Generate Map (Most Likely)**
- The project was run at 21:24
- UI loaded successfully
- User did NOT click "Generate Map" button
- Therefore `_update_2d_map_preview()` was never called
- No diagnostic output expected

**Scenario 2: Function Not Being Called**
- If user DID generate a map but no diagnostic output appears
- This would indicate `_update_2d_map_preview()` is not being called
- Or the function is failing before reaching diagnostic code

**Scenario 3: Logger Issue**
- Diagnostic code uses `Logger.debug("UI/WorldBuilder", ...)`
- Logger config shows `global_default_level: "VERBOSE"`
- DEBUG level (3) should be logged (VERBOSE (4) >= DEBUG (3))
- But "UI/WorldBuilder" system may not match Logger's system matching

## What Needs to Happen

### To Get Diagnostic Output:
1. **Run the project**
2. **Navigate to World Builder UI**
3. **Change world size** (e.g., select "Large" from dropdown)
4. **Click "Generate Map" button**
5. **Check the log file** for diagnostic output

### Expected Diagnostic Output (when map is generated):
```
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: === MAP PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC START ===
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: New texture size [{"width":4096,"height":4096,"texture_size":"(4096, 4096)"}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: BEFORE texture assignment [{"texture_rect_size":"(...)","custom_minimum_size":"(...)","expand_mode":1,"stretch_mode":5,"parent_size":"(...)","parent_type":"Panel"}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: IMMEDIATELY AFTER texture assignment [{"texture_rect_size":"(...)","texture_assigned":true,"texture_get_size":"(4096, 4096)"}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: AFTER mode changes [{"texture_rect_size":"(...)","custom_minimum_size":"(0, 0)","expand_mode":3,"stretch_mode":5}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: AFTER parent.update_minimum_size() [{"parent_size":"(...)","parent_size_changed":true/false}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: AFTER LAYOUT COMPLETE [{"texture_rect_size":"(...)","texture_rect_size_percent_of_parent":"(...)","custom_minimum_size":"(...)","texture_size":"(4096, 4096)","parent_size":"(...)","expand_mode":3,"stretch_mode":5,"texture_aspect_ratio":1.0,"rect_aspect_ratio":...,"parent_aspect_ratio":...,"expected_min_width_from_expand_mode":...,"is_filling_parent":true/false,"is_stuck_at_texture_size":true/false}]
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [WARN]: ⚠️ ISSUE DETECTED: ... (if problems found)
[timestamp] [UI/WorldBuilder] [DEBUG]: === MAP PREVIEW DIAGNOSTIC END ===
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Confirmed:
- Diagnostic code is present in source file
- Logger system is working (other DEBUG messages appear)
- UI/WorldBuilder system is logging (VERBOSE and INFO messages appear)

### ❌ Missing:
- No map generation in latest run
- No diagnostic output (because no map was generated)
- Cannot identify root cause without diagnostic data

## Conclusion

**The diagnostic code is ready and will produce output when:**
1. User generates a map (clicks "Generate Map" button)
2. `_update_2d_map_preview()` is called
3. The function executes the diagnostic logging code

**The latest run did NOT include map generation, so no diagnostic output is expected.**

**To identify the root cause of the texture resize issue:**
- User must run the project
- Generate a map at different sizes
- Check the log file for diagnostic output
- Analyze the diagnostic data to identify the problem

## Next Steps

1. **Run project and generate map** to trigger diagnostic output
2. **Review diagnostic output** in log file
3. **Identify specific issue** from diagnostic data:
   - Is TextureRect stuck at texture size?
   - Is parent container not resizing?
   - Is expand_mode causing issues?
   - Is layout timing the problem?
4. **Apply targeted fix** based on diagnostic findings
