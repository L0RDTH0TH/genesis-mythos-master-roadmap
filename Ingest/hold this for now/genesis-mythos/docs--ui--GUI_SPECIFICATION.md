# ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ║ GUI SPECIFICATION: PHILOSOPHY & STRUCTURAL GUIDELINES
# ║ GENESIS MYTHOS – FULL FIRST PERSON 3D VIRTUAL TABLETOP RPG IN GODOT 4.5.1
# ║ Valid for Grok AND Cursor – major changes require explicit approval
# ║ Date: 2025-12-17 | Status: Finalized & Integrated (v5 – GameGUI Removed for Runtime Reliability)
# ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INTEGRATION STATUS:** This specification has been integrated into the project rules as **Section 11** in:
- `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` (Cursor's version)
- `.cursor/rules/project-rules.md` (People version)

**IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-12-17):** GameGUI addon fully removed. Godot's built-in containers, size flags, anchors, theme overrides, and `UIConstants.gd` now handle all dynamic/responsive scaling needs. This eliminates runtime/export errors permanently while maintaining immersive, proportional layouts.

**USAGE:** This standalone document serves as a reference. For authoritative rules, consult the integrated Section 11 in the project rules files. Both versions are kept in sync.

## 1. GUI Philosophy (Core Principles – Never Compromise)
Our GUI design blends classic tabletop RPG tactility (e.g., character sheets, dice rolls) with immersive fantasy aesthetics, inspired by Baldur's Gate 3's worn parchment, ornate frames, and intuitive flow. The goal is a seamless, responsive interface that feels like an extension of the game's lore—ancient tomes and mystical artifacts—rather than a modern app overlay. For character creation and world generation menus (which are non-3D contexts), prioritize:

- **Immersion & Diegesis:** UI elements should feel "in-world" where possible (e.g., menus as floating scrolls or engraved stone tablets). Even flat 2D menus incorporate subtle fantasy flourishes like glowing runes or parchment textures. Avoid sleek/minimalist modern UIs; embrace ornate, thematic density without overwhelming the user.

- **Clarity & Intuitiveness:** Follow AAA RPG principles (e.g., BG3's UI): Clear hierarchy, consistent icons/symbols, and no unnecessary handholding. Users should navigate instinctively—e.g., tooltips for stats, visual feedback on hovers. Prioritize readability on varied hardware (mid-range PCs, potential future consoles).

- **Responsiveness & Accessibility:** All UI must adapt to any resolution/aspect ratio without clipping or distortion. No fixed pixels; everything relative or theme-driven. Support color-blind modes, scalable fonts, and keyboard/mouse/controller navigation from day one. UI must scale content (text, buttons, panels) proportionally while adapting layout.

- **Data-Driven & Extensible:** Align with project goals—100% JSON/Resources for content (e.g., races.json for character creation). UI layouts pull from configs for easy modding. Maintain 60 FPS even with complex menus.

- **Consistency with Project Rules:** Zero hard-coded values (use constants/theme overrides). All styling via `res://themes/bg3_theme.tres` (or migrated equivalent). GDScript only, typed, with proper headers/docstrings.

- **BG3-Inspired Touchpoints:** Menus evoke BG3's character creator (modular panels, 3D previews) and world maps (interactive overlays). But adapt for our virtual tabletop twist: e.g., world gen as a "ritual" wizard with procedural previews.

- **Dynamic Responsiveness Emphasis:** Leverage Godot's built-in containers, size flags, anchors, theme overrides, and `UIConstants.gd` for true dynamic scaling (e.g., text/buttons that proportionally grow/shrink while maintaining layout integrity across resolutions).

---

## 2. Structural Guidelines (Mandatory Practices)

### 2.1 Node Hierarchy & Layout Fundamentals

- **Root Node:** Always a `Control` or `CanvasLayer` for menus. Use `anchors_preset = 15` (PRESET_FULL_RECT) for full-screen coverage, ensuring it expands to viewport size.

- **Layout Containers as Default:** Build with nested containers for responsiveness:
  - Use `VBoxContainer` / `HBoxContainer` for vertical/horizontal stacking (e.g., stat rows, button rows, sidebar layouts).
  - Use `CenterContainer` for centering main content (e.g., title labels or 3D preview windows).
  - Use `MarginContainer` for consistent padding (pull margins from `UIConstants` or theme constants, not hard-coded pixels).
  - Use `HSplitContainer` / `VSplitContainer` for resizable panels (e.g., left-side options, right-side preview in world gen and character creation).
  - Avoid raw `Control` nodes without containers—they lead to manual positioning issues and poor responsiveness.

- **Size Flags:** Explicitly set on relevant children:
  - `size_flags_horizontal = Control.SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` (3) to allow horizontal growth.
  - `size_flags_vertical   = Control.SIZE_EXPAND_FILL` (3) to allow vertical growth.
  - Use `SIZE_FILL` / `SIZE_EXPAND` selectively for elements that should maintain intrinsic size (e.g., icons).

- **Anchors & Offsets:**
  - Prefer anchor presets (e.g., full rect, top, bottom) over manual anchors.
  - Keep offsets minimal and semantic (e.g., use UIConstants for margins instead of arbitrary numbers).

- **Advanced Proportional Scaling:**
  - Use theme overrides (font sizes, constants) + runtime calculations in `_notification(NOTIFICATION_RESIZED)` or `_notification(NOTIFICATION_THEME_CHANGED)` when needed.
  - Example: Recompute panel widths based on `get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size` and clamp to min/max values from `UIConstants`.

- **Hybrid Approach:**
  - Use built-in containers with explicit size flags and anchors for 95% of layouts.
  - Add small, focused custom scripts (optionally with `@tool`) only for rare, advanced dynamic behavior (e.g., special proportional layouts, auto-clamping behavior). Keep these scripts local to UI folders (`scripts/ui/`).

### 2.2 Sizing & Positioning Rules

- **No Magic Numbers:** Ban hard-coded pixels for sizes/positions (e.g., no `custom_minimum_size = Vector2(150, 0)` sprinkled across scenes). Replace with:
  - `UIConstants.gd` (primary source for semantic sizes like button heights).
    - Location: `res://scripts/ui/UIConstants.gd`
    - Implementation: `class_name UIConstants` (not autoload).
  - Theme constants (add to `bg3_theme.tres`, e.g., `constant/button_height_small = 50` for built-in styling).
  - Runtime calculations: e.g., `size = get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size * Vector2(0.8, 0.6)` for 80% width / 60% height.

- **Relative Positioning:**
  - Use anchors + margins instead of absolute offsets wherever possible.
  - Example: for a top-right debug overlay, anchor to `PRESET_TOP_RIGHT` and set `margin_right = -UIConstants.SPACING_MEDIUM` instead of hard-coding a position.

- **Responsive Testing:**
  - Every menu scene must handle window resize via `_notification(NOTIFICATION_RESIZED)` or equivalent.
  - Clamp positions to screen bounds to prevent off-screen issues (e.g., `position.x = clamp(position.x, 0.0, viewport_size.x - rect_size.x)`).

- **Standard Sizes (Defined in `UIConstants.gd`):**

| Category        | Name                  | Value | Usage Example                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| Button Height   | BUTTON_HEIGHT_SMALL   | 50    | Small action buttons                           |
|                 | BUTTON_HEIGHT_MEDIUM  | 80    | Standard menu buttons                          |
|                 | BUTTON_HEIGHT_LARGE   | 120   | Prominent calls-to-action (e.g., Generate World) |
| Label Width     | LABEL_WIDTH_NARROW    | 80    | Value displays (numbers, short tags)           |
|                 | LABEL_WIDTH_STANDARD  | 150   | Most descriptive labels                         |
|                 | LABEL_WIDTH_WIDE      | 200   | Long text fields (e.g., seed input)            |
| Spacing/Margin  | SPACING_SMALL         | 10    | Tight grouping                                  |
|                 | SPACING_MEDIUM        | 20    | Standard separation                             |
|                 | SPACING_LARGE         | 40    | Section breaks                                  |
| Icon Size       | ICON_SIZE_SMALL       | 32    | Inline icons                                    |
|                 | ICON_SIZE_MEDIUM      | 64    | Buttons, previews                               |
|                 | ICON_SIZE_LARGE       | 128   | Hero icons, logos                               |

---

### 2.3 Theme & Styling Integration

- **Central Theme Enforcement:**
  - Every `Control`-based UI scene uses `res://themes/bg3_theme.tres` as its theme.
  - Apply theme either at root (`theme = preload("res://themes/bg3_theme.tres")`) or via project settings.
  - Use overrides sparingly, only for hierarchy (e.g., larger fonts for titles), and document with comments.

- **Fantasy Aesthetics:**
  - Fonts: Ornate/serif for titles (e.g., gold-tinted `Color(1, 0.843, 0, 1)`).
  - Colors: Earthy tones, gradients for depth (e.g., parchment beige with shadow edges).
  - Icons/Textures: From `res://assets/icons/` or `res://assets/ui/`—e.g., scroll borders for panels.

- **Overrides vs. Hard-Codes:**
  - Prefer theme or `UIConstants` overrides (e.g., `theme_override_constants/separation = UIConstants.SPACING_MEDIUM`) over direct literals.

---

### 2.4 Specific Guidelines for Character Creation Menus

- **Structure:** Wizard-style flow (multi-step, like world builder UI).

  - **Root:**
    - Full-screen `Control` or `VBoxContainer` as root, with `anchors_preset = PRESET_FULL_RECT` and size flags set to expand/fill.

  - **Top (Title Area):**
    - `CenterContainer` containing a `Label` for the title.
    - Use theme overrides for font size and color (e.g., large gold title).

  - **Middle (Main Content Area):**
    - `HSplitContainer` or `HBoxContainer` for left/right layout:
      - **Left Panel:** `VBoxContainer` for options (race, class, stats), each row using reusable scenes like `AbilityScoreRow.tscn`.
      - **Right Panel:** `Panel` containing a `SubViewport` (3D preview) or `TextureRect` (baked render). The panel should use size flags and anchors to take ~40% of width, centered or right-aligned.

  - **Bottom (Navigation):**
    - `HBoxContainer` for Back/Next/Confirm buttons.
    - Buttons use `custom_minimum_size.y = UIConstants.BUTTON_HEIGHT_MEDIUM` and size flags to center horizontally.

- **Interactivity:**
  - Use raycasts for 3D model interaction (e.g., click/drag to rotate character).
  - Use signals to update preview dynamically as stats or selections change.

- **Data-Driven:**
  - Pull options from JSON (e.g., `fantasy_archetypes.json`, future `races.json`, `classes.json`).
  - Use `ItemList`, `OptionButton`, or `Tree` for lists depending on density.

---

### 2.5 Specific Guidelines for World Generation Menus

- **Structure:** 8-step wizard (built on existing `WorldBuilderUI.tscn` at `res://ui/world_builder/WorldBuilderUI.tscn`).

  - **Root:**
    - Full-screen `Control` with background texture (e.g., mystical map overlay) using a `TextureRect` or `ColorRect` + theme colors.

  - **Main Layout:**
    - `HSplitContainer` for left (controls) and right (previews):
      - **Left Panel (Step Controls):**
        - `VBoxContainer` with labels, sliders, dropdowns, and toggles.
        - Use `UIConstants` for label widths and spacing.
      - **Right Panel (Preview):**
        - `TabContainer` or stacked `Control` nodes allowing switching between 2D procedural map preview and 3D Terrain3D preview.
        - For 2D: `TextureRect` sized via anchors and size flags.
        - For 3D: `SubViewportContainer` + `SubViewport` sized via anchors and size flags.

  - **Progress/Step Indicator:**
    - `HBoxContainer` at top or bottom with step icons/labels.

  - **Bottom Controls:**
    - `HBoxContainer` for Back/Next/Generate buttons, using `UIConstants` for button heights and spacing.

- **3D Integration:**
  - After 2D map baking, allow toggling to a 3D view of the same world.
  - Use a simple camera (orbit/fly-cam) and minimal lights to avoid performance issues.

- **Progress Dialog:**
  - Use `Window` or `Panel` with `VBoxContainer` for:
    - Title/Status `Label`
    - `ProgressBar`
  - Size via content (e.g., padding from `UIConstants`), not fixed pixels.

---

### 2.6 Performance & Testing

- **Optimization:**
  - Limit draw calls by:
    - Reusing themes and styleboxes.
    - Using `NinePatchRect` for scalable backgrounds instead of large textures.
  - Ensure UI updates are lightweight (avoid expensive operations in `_process`).

- **Testing:**
  - Test with full UI active (complex scenes, multiple panels).
  - Validate 60 FPS on target hardware configurations.
  - Resize tests: 1080p, 1440p, 4K, ultrawide, windowed mode.

- **Audit Compliance:**
  - All new/changed UI must pass a mini-audit: no magic numbers, theme-applied, responsive on resize.

---

### 2.7 Accessibility Guidelines

- Support scalable UI via project setting `display/window/stretch/scale_mode = "fractional"`.
- Provide a high-contrast theme variant (future option toggle).
- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus indicators.
- Use color + icon/shape for critical information (avoid color-only cues).

---

### 2.8 Error Handling

Error states (e.g., failed world generation, invalid character data) should use a centered modal `Panel` with:
- A bold title `Label` (e.g., "World Generation Failed")
- A descriptive `Label` explaining the issue
- "Retry" and "Back" buttons in an `HBoxContainer`
- A distinct error-tinted style (e.g., reddish border) while remaining on-brand via theme.

---

## 3. Project Settings (Add to `project.godot`)

```ini
[display]
window/stretch/mode = "viewport"
window/stretch/aspect = "expand"
window/stretch/scale = 1.0
window/stretch/scale_mode = "fractional" # Enables UI scaling
```

---

## 4. Implementation Workflow (For Grok/Cursor Prompts)

- Start prompts with: `[GENESIS MYTHOS GUI SPEC v5 – BUILT-IN RESPONSIVE UI ONLY]`.
- For new menus: Specify scene path (e.g., `res://scenes/character_creation/CharacterCreator.tscn`), node tree, and scripts.
- For modifications: Audit before/after for compliance (e.g., replace magic numbers with `UIConstants` usage).
- Testing: Use `run_project` to verify no clipping on resize and stable FPS.
- All UI scripts must follow core project rules: exact header block, typed GDScript, one class per file, docstrings on public functions.

---

## 5. Migration Plan (Phased & Safe – GameGUI Removed)

1. **Phase 0: Setup & Cleanup**
   - Remove or archive the `res://addons/gamegui/` folder outside the project (no longer used).
   - Create `UIConstants.gd` at `res://scripts/ui/UIConstants.gd` with the canonical constants table from Section 2.2.
   - Update `project.godot` with display settings from Section 3.
   - Commit: `"feat/genesis: Remove GameGUI addon, add UIConstants.gd, and update project settings"`.

2. **Phase 1: Quick Wins (Low Risk)**
   - Refactor `MainMenu.tscn` (`res://scenes/MainMenu.tscn`):
     - Ensure root is full-screen `Control` or `VBoxContainer` with full rect anchors.
     - Use `VBoxContainer` / `HBoxContainer` for layout; remove any magic numbers.
     - Replace hard-coded button sizes with `UIConstants.BUTTON_HEIGHT_MEDIUM`.
   - Test responsiveness (window resize, different resolutions).
   - Commit: `"feat/genesis: Make MainMenu responsive with built-in containers and UIConstants"`.

3. **Phase 2: World Generation Menus**
   - Update `WorldBuilderUI.tscn` / `WorldBuilderUI.gd` at `res://ui/world_builder/`:
     - Replace any remaining magic numbers with `UIConstants` or theme constants.
     - Ensure all major panels use proper anchors and size flags.
     - Make previews rely on anchors/flags (no fixed viewport sizes).
   - Test responsiveness and performance while generating worlds.
   - Commit: `"feat/genesis: Refactor WorldBuilderUI to built-in responsive layout"`.

4. **Phase 2.5: Bulk Migrate Scenes**
   - Use Find in Files to locate:
     - `custom_minimum_size = Vector2(`
     - `offset_left`, `offset_top`, `offset_right`, `offset_bottom`
   - Replace with `UIConstants`-driven sizes or anchor/margin-based layouts.
   - Ensure each modified scene passes resize tests.

5. **Phase 3: Character Creation (Fresh Build)**
   - **Historical Context:** Character creation system previously existed but was removed 2025-01-09 (commit "Nuked busted UI systems for clean restart"). The old system suffered from **insurmountable issues due to fundamental design choices made at the beginning**—not GameGUI-related, but architectural decisions that made the system unmaintainable. Rather than attempting migration, we will build a fresh implementation using current best practices.
   
   - **Build Approach:** Create new character creation system from scratch using:
     - Built-in containers (`VBoxContainer`, `HBoxContainer`, `HSplitContainer`, etc.) with explicit size flags and anchors
     - `UIConstants.gd` for all sizing (no magic numbers)
     - Theme `res://themes/bg3_theme.tres` for styling
     - Follow guidelines from Section 2.4 (Character Creation Menus)
   
   - **Implementation Steps:**
     1. **Create folder structure:**
        - `res://scenes/character_creation/` (main scene folder)
        - `res://scripts/character_creation/` (main script folder)
        - `res://scripts/character_creation/tabs/` (tab scripts)
        - `res://scripts/character_creation/components/` (reusable UI components)
     
     2. **Main Scene:** `res://scenes/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.tscn`
        - Root: Full-screen `Control` with `anchors_preset = PRESET_FULL_RECT`
        - Layout: Follow Section 2.4 structure (Title area, HSplitContainer for left/right panels, bottom navigation)
        - Attach script: `res://scripts/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.gd`
     
     3. **Main Script:** `res://scripts/character_creation/CharacterCreationRoot.gd`
        - Handle wizard-style flow (multi-step navigation)
        - Manage tab switching and data persistence
        - Integrate 3D preview system (SubViewport for character model)
        - Use signals for tab completion and navigation
     
     4. **Tab Scenes & Scripts:** Create tab scenes for each step:
        - `RaceTab.tscn` / `RaceTab.gd` - Race selection
        - `ClassTab.tscn` / `ClassTab.gd` - Class selection
        - `BackgroundTab.tscn` / `BackgroundTab.gd` - Background selection
        - `AbilityScoreTab.tscn` / `AbilityScoreTab.gd` - Ability score allocation
        - `AppearanceTab.tscn` / `AppearanceTab.gd` - Appearance customization with 3D preview
        - `NameConfirmTab.tscn` / `NameConfirmTab.gd` - Final confirmation
        - Each tab follows Section 2.4 guidelines (left panel options, right panel preview)
     
     5. **Data Files:** Create JSON data files (if not already present):
        - `res://data/races.json` - Race definitions
        - `res://data/classes.json` - Class definitions
        - `res://data/backgrounds.json` - Background definitions
        - `res://data/abilities.json` - Ability score definitions
     
     6. **3D Preview System:**
        - Create `CharacterPreview3D.gd` script for managing 3D character model in SubViewport
        - Support race/model switching, rotation via raycast interaction
        - Integrate with AppearanceTab for real-time preview updates
     
     7. **Testing:**
        - Test responsive layout (1080p, 4K, ultrawide, window resize)
        - Verify tab navigation flow
        - Test 3D preview interaction
        - Validate data loading from JSON files
     
     8. **Commit:** `"feat/genesis: Implement fresh character creation system with built-in responsive UI"`
   
   - **Key Principles:**
     - **No legacy code dependencies** - Fresh implementation avoids old architectural issues
     - **Data-driven** - All content from JSON files (races, classes, backgrounds)
     - **Responsive by design** - Built-in containers + UIConstants from the start
     - **Theme-consistent** - Use `bg3_theme.tres` throughout
     - **Modular** - Reusable component scenes for common UI patterns

6. **Phase 4: Global Polish**
   - Make progress dialogs and overlays fully responsive:
     - Use `Panel`/`Window` + containers and `UIConstants`.
   - Perform a final audit: no remaining magic numbers, all UI responsive.
   - Commit: `"feat/genesis: Global UI polish with built-in responsive layout"`.

**Rule:** Migrate one scene at a time. Use `run_project` after each to verify no clipping/FPS drop.
